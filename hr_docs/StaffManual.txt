1 INTRODUCTION

1.0 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO

Dear Valued Team Member,
Welcome to our family! It is with genuine excitement and gratitude that I welcome
you to the Rouxbe team. The document you're reading marks the beginning of what I
hope will be a remarkable journey of growth, innovation, and meaningful impact.
Every person who joins our team brings unique talents, perspectives, and experiences
that enrich our collective mission. We didn't just hire you for what you can do today,
we invited you to be part of our story because we see the potential in you to help
shape the future of learning and development.
At the heart of our organization is a profound belief: education has the power to
transform lives. Every course we develop, every feature we implement, and every
learner we support represents an opportunity to make someone's tomorrow better
than their today. As you settle into your role, I encourage you to keep this purpose at
the center of your work, knowing that your contributions extend far beyond the
immediate tasks at hand.
Our industry is evolving rapidly, and the challenges we face will require creativity,
resilience, and collaboration. There will be days of tremendous achievement and days
that test our resolve. On both kinds of days, please remember that you are never
alone here. We succeed together, we learn together, and we grow together.
I make these commitments to you:
• We will foster an environment where your voice matters and your ideas can
flourish
• We will provide the support, tools, and resources you need to excel
• We will recognize your contributions and celebrate your achievements

PAGE 6

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
• We will prioritize your professional development and work-life balance
• We will cultivate a culture of respect, inclusion, and belonging
In return, I ask that you bring your authentic self to work each day, embrace our
values, challenge conventional thinking, and never lose sight of the learners whose
lives we aim to improve.
This employee manual contains important information about our policies, benefits,
and expectations. While it addresses many practical aspects of working here, what it
cannot fully capture is the spirit of innovation and care that defines our community.
My virtual door is always open, and I genuinely look forward to getting to know you.
Together, we will create not just an exceptional learning platform, but a better, more
accessible future of education for all.
With warmest regards and highest hopes,
Gary M. Apito

1.1 WELCOME TO THE ROUXBE FAMILY! - MESSAGE FROM THE
FOUNDERS

Thank you for choosing Rouxbe as your new place of employment. Finding the
right people to help us build our great Company is always challenging. While there
are often many qualified candidates for a particular role, finding someone like you
that has the experience, expertise, and most importantly, the passion for helping
us improve the lives of so many people is rare. We are grateful for your decision to
join us.
As you begin your journey with us, remember one over-riding goal of ours as
founders, is to help you move down your own personal path. That’s right! Your
path. You expressed an interest in working with us and we selected you as our
desired candidate because we felt that in some small way, we could help you
move forward personally. Of course, we also thought you’d be great in your role,
but that comes secondary to us. Perhaps you were looking for a better work-life

balance so you could spend more time with your family, go to the gym during non-
peak hours, or you simply wanted to find a working role where you could turn

your strengths into products and services that truly helped people transform their
lives. Whatever the case may be for you, Rouxbe places you, your family, and your
life in front of organizational objectives. Your accomplishments in this new role,
while contributing to Rouxbe’s success, will also help our amazing staff (your new
Rouxbe family members) all move forward personally as well. So, expect to be
welcomed with open arms and supported by them in any way you need. All you
have to do is ask.
With that said, we do have one expectation of you and that is to simply be open
and honest about how you are feeling in your new role at all times. Don’t bottle up
any frustrations, rather feel free to bring them forward to anyone on the team,
colleague or supervisor. It’s in this spirit of open, transparent and honest
communication that our working relationship will thrive. You can expect the same
from us.
To support our ongoing relationship, we have put together this Employee
Handbook to provide you with answers to most of the questions that you may

PAGE 8

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
have about Rouxbe’s benefit programs, as well as the Company’s policies and
procedures that all Rouxbe team members abide by. These include both the
responsibilities the Company expects of you, and the responsibilities you can
expect from the Company. Please take the time to review this manual in its
entirety and bring forth any questions you may have, or clarifications you may
need, to fully understand all the material that governs your work life at Rouxbe
moving forward.
Thank you again for entrusting us with your time and energies by joining the
Rouxbe family. We wish you the very best in your new role and look forward to
getting to know you better over the years ahead as we join forces to improve the
lives of millions of people that need our support.
Sincerely,

Joe Girard
Co-Founder/Board Member

Dawn Thomas

1.2 ROUXBE OVERVIEW
Rouxbe’s focus has shifted over the years since we were founded. This evolution
has occurred over the 20 years of our existence. Our initial focus on teaching the
world how to cook through our online training platform has deepened.
ROUXBE: Bridging Workforce Readiness Gaps with Scalable, Dynamic Solutions
In today's rapidly evolving workplace landscape, organizations face unprecedented
challenges in maintaining a skilled, adaptable workforce. Rouxbe has emerged as a
global leader in workforce and competency-based education, empowering
organizations to dynamically upskill their teams and close readiness gaps, even in
the most complex, security-critical environments.
Redefining Workforce Readiness Through Innovation
Rouxbe stands apart in the ed-tech space through its commitment to meaningful
outcomes rather than simply checking training boxes. Its innovative digital
platform combines professional-grade content with real-time adaptability, offering
tailored, data-driven training solutions that deliver measurable results.
"We've moved beyond the traditional training model to focus on true workforce
readiness," explains Rouxbe's approach. "Our programs don't just transfer
knowledge - they transform capabilities, ensuring teams can perform effectively
from day one."
This transformation occurs through powerful implementation programs that help
organizations execute their workforce development strategies, not just plan them.
From strategic onboarding to continuous professional development, Rouxbe
equips teams with the tools they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive
landscape.
Dynamic Solutions for Complex Environments

What truly distinguishes Rouxbe is its expertise in delivering training for high-
stakes industries. Whether in healthcare, logistics, hospitality, or government

sectors, Rouxbe's programs integrate seamlessly into complex workflows where
compliance, safety, and operational excellence are non-negotiable.

PAGE 10

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
The company's competency-based approach emphasizes practical application over
rote learning, ensuring learners acquire the dynamically evolving skills necessary
to succeed in their roles. This focus on real-world application translates to
immediate performance improvements and long-term career growth.
Customization at Scale
Recognizing that no two organizations face identical challenges, Rouxbe partners
with enterprises to design training programs aligned with specific goals:
Addressing regional compliance requirements
Improving operational efficiencies
Closing specific skills gaps
Enhancing employee retention and satisfaction
This customization doesn't come at the expense of scalability. Rouxbe's hybrid

learning models, combining comprehensive online education with targeted in-
person training when needed, enable organizations to scale their training

programs without compromising quality or effectiveness.
Solving Workforce Challenges That Matter
Rouxbe's impact extends beyond individual skill development to address systemic
challenges facing organizations today:
Workforce Shortages: Accelerating onboarding and upskilling to meet immediate
needs
Employee Retention: Creating clear pathways for growth and development
Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring teams meet evolving standards across
jurisdictions
Operational Excellence: Embedding best practices into everyday workflows
This comprehensive approach is guided by Rouxbe's leadership team, which brings

PAGE 11

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
decades of experience across education, culinary arts, logistics, and other critical
industries. Their expertise ensures that every program is grounded in real-world
knowledge and tailored to meet industry-specific challenges.
Seamless Integration with Organizational Goals
Understanding that effective training can't exist in isolation, Rouxbe collaborates
closely with internal learning and development teams. By leveraging existing
communication channels and aligning training programs with broader
organizational objectives, Rouxbe ensures seamless implementation and high
levels of engagement.
This collaborative approach has established Rouxbe as more than a training
provider - it's a strategic partner in workforce development, helping organizations
build teams that are ready to meet today's challenges and tomorrow's
opportunities.
Through its innovative platform, industry expertise, and commitment to
measurable outcomes, Rouxbe continues to set the standard for workforce
readiness in a rapidly changing world. By combining cutting-edge technology with
deep industry knowledge, Rouxbe delivers solutions that don't just bridge skills
gaps, they transform organizational capabilities.

1.3 A WORD ABOUT THIS HANDBOOK
The provisions of the Rouxbe Employee Handbook do not create contractual
obligations with respect to any matters it covers. Nor is this Employee Handbook
intended to create a contract guaranteeing that you will be employed for any
specific time period.
This Employee Handbook refers to current benefit plans maintained by Rouxbe.
Refer to the actual plan documents or contact Rouxbe’s Controller if you have
specific questions regarding the benefit plans. The language contained in the plan
documents takes precedent.

Rouxbe’s Controller is:
Isis Kearney
isis@rouxbe.com
Lastly, throughout this document, both the terms “Company” and “Rouxbe” have
been used, and it is important to note that they are interchangeable.
A copy of the Employee Handbook can be found in the Rouxbe sharefile.

PAGE 14

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
2 THE WAY WE WORK
2.1 AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT
Rouxbe is an at-will employer. This means that regardless of any provision in this
employee handbook, either you or Rouxbe may terminate the employment
relationship at any time, with or without reason, or with or without notice.
Nothing in this handbook, or in any documents or statement, written or oral, shall
limit the right to terminate employment at-will. Similarly, Rouxbe can alter job
duties, compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment at
any time.
No representative of the Company has any authority to enter into any agreement
for employment for any specified period, or to make other commitments or
promises or assure any benefit or terms and conditions of employment, unless
such promises are made in writing and signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, Gary Apito (gary@rouxbe.com).
Please refer to The Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement for
additional terms of employment.
For B.C. employees: The provisions of the Employment Standards Act, exclusively,
will be followed with respect to ‘without cause’ terminations.
2.2 NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION
Upon joining Rouxbe, you were given access to this Employee Handbook. Please
ensure you sign the signature page at the end of the handbook and return it to
your manager or the Controller. If you have any questions about the content of
this Handbook, or any other employee benefit(s), please contact your manager or
the Controller. Your manager will be responsible for a wide variety of initiatives
once you have joined us to facilitate your onboarding and welcome you to the
team.

PAGE 15

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
2.3 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
Rouxbe is an equal opportunity employer. Rouxbe does not discriminate in
recruiting, hiring, transfers, promotions, compensation, benefits, and training or
other employment practices.
Rouxbe strictly follows personnel procedures that will ensure equal opportunity
for all people without regard to race, color, religion, creed, age, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, marital status, partnership status, veteran status,
citizenship status, national origin, disability, or any other characteristic protected
by federal, state, provincial or local law.
All employees must comply with applicable equal employment opportunity laws.
Anyone that has questions or concerns is encouraged to bring these issues to the
Controller. If the compliance issue involves the Controller, notify the next level of
management. Any employee found to be engaging in any type of unlawful
discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment. Employees will not be retaliated against for bringing
forward complaints. Any employee who perceives retaliation should notify the
Controller.
2.4 REASONABLE ACCOMODATION POLICY
Rouxbe is committed to providing equal opportunities to qualified individuals with
disabilities. We will make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or
mental disabilities of otherwise qualified employment candidates and current
employees to the extent required by applicable law.
Any employee or job applicant who requires accommodation to perform the essential
functions of their position should contact the Controller to request such
accommodation. Upon receiving an accommodation request, Rouxbe will engage in an
interactive process with the individual to identify potential reasonable accommodation
that would enable the individual to perform the essential job functions.
Rouxbe may request verification of the need for accommodation from the individual's
health care provider when appropriate. All medical information received during this
process will be treated as confidential in accordance with applicable laws.

PAGE 16

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
We are dedicated to addressing each accommodation request promptly and finding
effective solutions that balance the needs of the individual with the requirements of
the organization. Accommodations will be determined on a case-by-case basis,
considering the specific limitations of the individual and the essential functions of the
particular job.

2.5 NON-HARASSMENT
We prohibit harassment of our job applicants, contractors, employees, customers,
vendors or any other third party by another employee, supervisor, vendor,
customer, or any third party. Any form of harassment (actions, jokes, words or
comments) based on an individual’s race, color, religion, creed, age, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, marital status, partnership status, veteran status,
citizenship status, national origin, disability or any other characteristic protected
by federal, state, provincial or local law will not be tolerated in the workplace. We
have zero tolerance for harassment and are committed to a workplace free of any
harassment. This policy prohibits inappropriate conduct even if it does not rise to
the legal definition of harassment.
While it is not easy to define precisely what harassment is, it includes: unwelcome
verbal, visual, or physical conduct creating an intimidating, offensive, or hostile
work environment that interferes with work performance. Harassment can be
verbal (slurs, epithets, threats, derogatory comments, unwelcome jokes and
teasing), graphic (including offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings,
computer displays, or e- mails) or physical conduct (including physically
threatening another). Because it is difficult to define unlawful harassment,
employees are expected to always behave professionally and in a respectful
manner.
Sexual harassment, like other forms of illegal harassment, is against our policy and
is prohibited under federal, state, and provincial law.
We firmly prohibit sexual harassment of any employee by another employee,
supervisor or third party. Harassment of third parties by our employees is also
prohibited. The purpose of this policy is not to regulate the morality of employees.

PAGE 17

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
it is to assure that in the workplace, no employee is subject to sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment of an employee will not be tolerated and is unacceptable in the

workplace and in any work-related settings such as business trips and business-
related social functions.

Any employee who feels that he or she is a victim of such harassment should
immediately report the matter to the Controller. If the Controller is the cause of
the problem, or if he or she seems unwilling to resolve the issue, then contact the
next level of management. We will investigate all such reports as confidentially as
possible. Adverse action will not be taken against an employee because he or she
reports or participates in the investigation of a violation of this policy. Violations of
this policy are not permitted and may result in disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.
2.6 TALK TO US
We encourage you to bring your questions, suggestions and complaints to our
attention. We will carefully consider each of these in our continuing effort to
improve operations. We want each employee to feel free to offer their personal
recommendations for improvements, as well as discuss any problems they may be
experiencing on the job.
We are committed to maintaining a positive and pleasant working environment.
We believe that an open-door policy is the best method for our employees. If you
feel you have a problem, present the situation to your supervisor so that the
problem can be settled by examination and discussion of the facts. You can also
speak with the Controller.
Your suggestions and comments on any subject are important, and we encourage
you to take every opportunity to discuss them with us. Your job will not be
adversely affected in any way because you choose to use this procedure. We will
respectfully listen to your concerns and do our best to address them.

PAGE 18

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
2.7 CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYMENT
Introductory Period
All full-time and part-time employees are subject to an introductory period during
their first 90 days of employment. During this period, you will be able to assess if
your new job is suitable for you and your supervisor will have an opportunity to
evaluate your work performance.
● Full-time employees work a minimum of a 40-hour workweek. These
employees are normally eligible for all the benefits listed in this manual,
subject to plan terms.
● Part-time employees work less than 30 hours each week. These employees
are eligible for limited-provided benefits listed in this manual.
● In addition to the preceding, employees are also categorized as "exempt" or
"non-exempt."
o Exempt employees are subject to applicable federal, state, and
provincial law, not entitled to overtime pay, and are not subject to
certain deductions to their weekly salary under Rouxbe’s policies.
o Non-Exempt Employees are entitled to overtime pay as required by
applicable federal, state, and provincial law.
It is our policy that exempt employees’ pay will not be “docked,” or subject to
deductions, in violation of salary pay rules issued by the United States Department
of Labor and any corresponding rules issued by the state government, as
applicable; however, we may make deductions from employees’ salaries in a way
that is permitted under federal, state, and provincial wage and hour rules. Exempt
employees will be reimbursed in full for any isolated, inadvertent, or improper
deductions, as defined by law.
Thus, exempt employees may be subject to the following salary deductions,
except where prohibited by law, including for the following reasons:
● Absences of one or more full days for personal reasons, other than sickness
or disability;
● Absences of one or more full days due to sickness or disability, if there is a
plan, policy, or practice providing replacement compensation for such

PAGE 19

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
absences.
● Absences of one or more full days before eligibility under such a plan, policy,
or practice or after replacement compensation for such absences has been
exhausted.
● Suspension for violations of safety rules of major significance.
● Suspensions of one or more full days for violations of workplace conduct
rules, such as rules against sexual harassment and workplace violence.
● Payment of actual time worked in the first and last weeks of employment,
resulting in a proportional rate of an employee’s full salary.
● Any unpaid leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act; or
● Negative paid-time-off balances, in whole-day increments only.
If you are unsure of your exempt or non-exempt classification, inform your
supervisor who will discuss with the Controller regarding the appropriate
classification.
2.8 IMMIGRATION REFORM AND CONTROL ACT
For US-based staff, in compliance with the federal Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), as amended, we are committed to employing only
individuals who are authorized to work in the United States.
Each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the
Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation
establishing identity and employment eligibility. This documentation must be
provided within 3 business days of starting employment with us. The inability to
provide this documentation within 3 business days is grounds for termination.
If you are authorized to work in the country for a limited time period, you will be
required to submit proof of renewed employment eligibility prior to expiration of
that period to remain employed by Rouxbe.

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
2.9 ROUXBE’S WORK FROM HOME GUIDELINE
Embracing Flexibility in How We Work

At Rouxbe, we believe exceptional work can happen anywhere. Our work-from-
home approach isn't just about location... it's about empowering you to create

are designed to help you succeed in a remote setting while staying connected to
our shared mission.
Setting Yourself Up for Success - Your Digital Workspace
Equipment Empowerment: We'll provide technology to ensure you have the tools
you need, whether that's a laptop, a second monitor, or noise-canceling
headphones.
Connectivity Support: Strong internet is essential, if you need to upgrade your
service for reliable video calls, we'll have established a $50 monthly stipend
toward your internet costs.
Tech Troubleshooting: Patrick is always available through his Slack channel for
quick resolution of technical issues.
Your Physical Space
Dedicated Area: Designate a specific work area when possible, even if it's just a
corner of a room, to help create mental boundaries between work and personal
life.

ensure your setup supports your physical well-being.
Personal Touch: Make your space inspiring, plants, good lighting, and personal
items can boost creativity and satisfaction. What works for you?
Reimagining Collaboration - Communication Rhythms

10 AM - 3 PM in your local time zone for scheduling team meetings and

PAGE 21

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
collaborative sessions.
Response Expectations: We trust you to respond to messages within 4 business
hours during your workday, but not during your designated focus time or after

in deep work, stepping away for lunch, or finished for the day.
Meeting Mindfulness

or unincumbered focus.
Virtual Water Cooler: Join our optional monthly virtual coffee breaks to maintain

approach: 50 minutes of focus followed by a 10-minute break.
Boundary Setting: Communicate your working hours to your team and honor
others' boundaries by scheduling messages to send during their working hours.
Wellbeing Priorities

collaboration while supporting your individual needs, because when you thrive,

3 YOUR PAY AND PROGRESS
3.1 RECORDING YOUR TIME
Non-exempt employees will record their time using the Just Works Self-Service
Portal. Hours should be entered daily, and any errors or fixes should be submitted
to payroll 2 days prior to the last day of the pay period or as requested by the
Payroll Department.
All employees subject to this policy are required to accurately record all-time
worked. Altering or falsifying your time records or completing another employee’s
time and attendance records, except as directed, are grounds for disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
For payroll purposes, the workweek starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.
3.2 PAY DAY
Canadian employees are paid semi-monthly. The first pay period starts on the 1st
of the month and ends on the 15th of the month. The second pay period starts on
the 16th of the month and ends on the last day of the month. Paydays fall on the
15th and last day of each month.
U.S. employees are paid every two weeks. Follow the pay date schedule in Just
Works. When our payday falls on a holiday or weekend, you will be paid on the
business day before the holiday or weekend.
Please review your paycheck for every payroll for errors. If you find a mistake,
report it to your supervisor immediately. Your supervisor will assist you in taking
the steps necessary to correct the error. Any overpayments or underpayments will
be corrected on the first payroll after the mistake is brought to our attention.

PAGE 24

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
If any other payroll questions arise, please feel free to e-mail the payroll
department at accounting@rouxbe.com.

Direct Deposit
Rouxbe pays through direct deposit which deposits your wages directly into your
bank account(s). The Controller will provide you with instructions during your New
Hire Orientation.
Paycheck Deductions
We are required by law to make certain deductions from your paycheck each pay
period. Such deductions typically include federal, state and/or provincial taxes and
Social Security (FICA) taxes. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you are
employed and the benefits you choose, there may be additional deductions. If you
wish to have additional voluntary deductions deducted from your pay, it is your
responsibility to contact the Controller. All deductions and the amount of the
deductions are listed on your pay stub. W-2’s for U.S. employees and TD1’s for
Canadian employees will be sent out on or before January 31st of each calendar
year.
3.3 INTERNAL JOB POSTINGS
It is our goal as an organization to promote and grow qualified individuals from
within the organization. If an internal opportunity arises, you will be notified by
the hiring manager of the job description and deadline to apply. In most cases, a
period of 6 months must have passed for you to be considered for an internal
position.
The internal application process will be as follows:
• Rouxbe will post the position internally
• Contact the hiring manager about your interest in the position
• If you meet the internal transfer requirements you would then submit your
application within the set timeframe

3.4 OUR APPROACH TO PERFORMANCE REVIEWS AND
COMPENSATION
Our Philosophy
At Rouxbe, we believe that meaningful growth happens through partnership, open
dialogue, and a shared commitment to excellence. Our performance review and
compensation process reflect this belief, designed not as a one-way evaluation, but as a
collaborative journey toward both individual and organizational success.
We see each team member as a vital contributor to our mission, bringing unique talents
and perspectives that strengthen our collective impact. This policy outlines how we
nurture your professional development while recognizing your contributions through
fair and thoughtful compensation practices.
The Annual Growth Conversation
Rather than traditional performance "reviews," we engage in annual Growth
Conversations. These structured yet personalized discussions create space for:
• Celebrating achievements and milestones from the past year
• Exploring opportunities for skill development and career advancement
• Setting inspiring, meaningful goals that align with both your aspirations and our
organizational vision
• Identifying resources and support needed for your continued success
These conversations take place annually near your work anniversary date, though your
manager will maintain regular check-ins throughout the year to provide ongoing
feedback and support.
Our Approach to Compensation Growth
We believe in rewarding the value you bring to our team and our learners. Our
compensation philosophy centers on:
• Transparency: Clear communication about how compensation decisions are made

PAGE 26

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
• Fairness: Consistent application of compensation practices across the organization
• Market Competitiveness: Regular market analysis to ensure our compensation
remains competitive
• Recognition of Growth: Acknowledging both performance excellence and skill
development
• Organizational Context: Balancing individual recognition with our overall financial
health
Following your annual Growth Conversation, your manager will collaborate with our
leadership team to determine appropriate compensation adjustments based on:
• Your performance against established goals and expectations
• Acquisition of new skills, certifications, or capabilities that enhance your
contribution
• Expanded responsibilities or scope within your role
• Internal equity considerations
• Market conditions and company performance
Our Shared Commitment
We commit to making thoughtful, fair decisions about compensation and providing
clear explanations for those decisions. We recognize that compensation discussions can
sometimes feel uncertain or challenging, and we welcome honest, respectful dialogue
throughout this process.
We invite you to actively participate in your Growth Conversation by:
• Reflecting on your achievements and areas for development
• Sharing your career aspirations and interests
• Proposing meaningful goals that energize and inspire you
• Asking questions about how you can continue to grow and contribute
Together, we'll create a path forward that honors your contributions, supports your
growth, and strengthens our collective ability to deliver exceptional learning
experiences.
Implementation Timeline
Growth Conversations will be scheduled approximately 2 weeks before your work
anniversary date. Any approved compensation adjustments will take effect on your
anniversary date and will be reflected in the following pay period.

________________________________________
This policy is designed to provide guidance on our approach to performance reviews and
compensation. While we are committed to its principles, specific implementation may evolve as
our organization grows and changes. Any questions about this policy should be directed to your
manager or the Controller.

3.5 WORKING TOGETHER TO MEET OUR GOALS: OVERTIME
POLICY
Our Commitment to Excellence
At Rouxbe, we're passionate about delivering exceptional experiences for our
customers. Sometimes, this dedication means coming together as a team to meet
specific deadlines or customer needs outside our regular schedule. When these
opportunities arise, we want to ensure clarity, fairness, and appreciation for your
additional contributions.
How We Navigate Overtime Together
When our customers or projects require additional time commitment, we'll provide
as much advance notice as possible. We recognize that your time is valuable, and
we strive to balance our business needs with respect for your personal time.
Non-exempt team members who contribute more than 40 hours in a workweek
(Sunday through Saturday) will receive compensation at one-and-a-half times their
regular hourly rate, in accordance with applicable laws. This reflects our
appreciation for your extra effort and dedication.
To ensure we're coordinating effectively, please partner with your manager to
receive pre-approval for any overtime hours. This collaborative approach helps us
plan resources efficiently while recognizing your willingness to go above and
beyond.
Understanding Overtime Calculations
We calculate overtime based on actual hours worked beyond 40 hours in a
workweek. While we value all your time - including holidays and paid time off - only
active working hours count toward overtime calculations.

PAGE 28

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
For example:
If you work 8 hours Monday, use 8 hours of PTO Tuesday, and work 8.5 hours
Wednesday through Friday, your total working hours would be 33.5, which wouldn't
trigger overtime compensation.
Similarly, during holiday weeks, only your actual working hours count toward the
40-hour threshold for overtime.
If our pay period crosses a workweek boundary, remember that we still calculate
overtime based on the complete Sunday-through-Saturday cycle.
Our Shared Responsibility
We value your contribution and want to properly recognize additional time worked.
That's why we ask that all overtime be discussed and approved in advance. This
mutual understanding helps us maintain both operational excellence and
appropriate compensation practices.
If you have questions about how this policy applies to your specific situation, please
reach out to the Controller, who is here to support you with clear guidance and
information.
Together, we can balance delivering exceptional service while honoring our
commitments to each team member's wellbeing and fair compensation.

4.1 MEDICAL AND DENTAL INSURANCE
Full-time employees who work 30 hours or more per week are eligible to
participate in Rouxbe’s insurance plan(s). You are eligible to enroll on the first of
the next month after your start date or during Open Enrollment. However, if you
undergo a change in family status, you may make a change in coverage provided
you do so within 30 days from the date of the qualifying event. You may not make
a mid-year change from one medical carrier to another. If you have questions
regarding insurance coverage, please contact the Controller.
To assist you with the cost of this insurance, Rouxbe pays 100% of employee
coverage and 100% of monthly premiums for spouse or family coverage. Rouxbe
makes this commitment to our teams and their families, so they don’t have to
worry about the cost of insurance. We are also committed to providing a high
level of health plan (platinum and gold) so our team members and their families
are taken care of.
A booklet containing the details of the plan and eligibility requirements may be
obtained from the Controller. Refer to the actual plan document and summary
plan description if you have specific questions regarding benefit plans. Those
documents take precedent.
4.2 CELEBRATING TOGETHER: OUR HOLIDAY POLICY
Honoring Time to Refresh and Reconnect
At Rouxbe, we believe that quality time away from work is essential for creativity,
wellbeing, and bringing your best self to our shared mission. Our holiday policy
reflects our commitment to supporting your work-life harmony while maintaining
our service excellence.
Your Holiday Benefits
We're pleased to welcome you to our holiday benefits program from day one! As a
full-time non-exempt team member, you'll begin enjoying paid holidays
immediately upon joining our team, no waiting period required.

PAGE 34

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
For our full-time exempt colleagues, we provide holiday pay in complete alignment
with federal, state, and provincial wage and hour regulations, ensuring you can fully
disconnect and enjoy these important occasions.
Special Considerations for Government Project Teams
We recognize the unique nature of government partnerships. If you're contributing
to U.S. Government initiatives such as DoDEA or MSC projects, your holiday
schedule will follow the federal guidelines specific to your project. This ensures
seamless coordination with our government partners while honoring public service
holiday traditions.
Our Collective Celebration
Holidays represent more than just time away, they're opportunities to celebrate,
recharge, and return with renewed energy for the important work we do together.
We encourage you to fully embrace these moments, knowing that taking time to
rest contributes to our shared success and innovation.
Should you have any questions about how our holiday policy applies to your specific
role or situation, please don't hesitate to contact your manager or our HR team.
We're here to support your well-being both during working hours and as you enjoy
a well-deserved time off.

4.3 UNLIMITED - PAID TIME OFF (PTO)
As of December 1, 2024, Rouxbe will no longer track accrued PTO hours. Employees
are eligible for Unlimited PTO at 90 days of employment. Employees are
encouraged to take the time they need to rest and recharge, without the constraint
of a predetermined allotment of vacation or sick days.
● Minimum Time Off: While not required, we strongly recommend that

PAGE 36

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
employees take at least three weeks off annually to fully disconnect and
benefit from extended breaks.
● Manager Approval: Submit PTO requests through the ADP / Justworks portal
to your direct manager as early as possible. Update the Company calendar
with your requested days off. Managers approve PTO at their discretion,
considering factors such as department needs, other team requests, and peak
coverage times.
● Coverage: Unlimited PTO encompasses sick days, vacation, bereavement,
company holidays, jury duty, birthdays, volunteer service commitments, and
any other occasions when an employee needs to step away. Please note that
this policy does not replace our separate policies addressing Military, Family,
Medical, Maternity, Domestic Violence, and Parental leave.
● PTO Requests: Employees should submit requests through the ADP/Justworks
portal and update the company calendar accordingly.
● Conflict Resolution: In situations where multiple team members from the
same department request the same time off, preference will be given to the
employee with the longest tenure.
4.4 MILITARY LEAVE
Individuals who risk their lives to serve in the military deserve appreciation and
respect from everyone when they return to their civilian careers. Under the
Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Act (USERRA), any
employee who is absent from work because of “service in the uniformed services,”
will be given the necessary time off and reinstated in accordance with federal and
state law. An employee who is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States
or in state military service would be defined as: on active duty, active duty for
training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, or on full-time
National Guard duty.
The time off will be unpaid, except where state law dictates otherwise. Exempt
employees may be provided time off with pay when necessary to comply with

PAGE 37

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
state and federal wage and hour laws.
Accrued PTO may be used for this leave if you choose. Military orders should be
presented to your supervisor and arrangements for leave made as early as
possible before departure. You are required to give advance notice of your service
obligations to us unless military necessity makes this impossible. You must notify
your supervisor and the Controller of your intent to return to employment based
on the requirements of the law. Your benefits may continue to accrue during the
period of leave in accordance with state and federal law.
Return from Leave
Employees seeking re-employment following a period of covered USERRA service
must either return to work or apply for re-employment within a specified time,
depending on the duration of their leave as follows:
Thirty days or less: You are eligible for reinstatement if you report for work by the
first regular workday that occurs at least eight hours after your physical return to
your residence after completion of your military service. If you cannot meet the
above deadline through no fault of your own, you can report as soon as
reasonably possible.

Thirty-one days to 180 days: You must submit an oral or written application for re-
employment no later than 14 days after completing service, or, if unable to do so

through no fault of your own, by the next day that it is reasonably possible to
submit an application.

More than 180 days: You must submit an oral or written application for re-
employment no more than 90 days after completing service.

Reinstatement
Upon completion of military service, you will be reinstated with all the rights and
benefits you would have had if you had remained continuously employed.

If you return following 90 or fewer days of military service, you will be re-
employed in the position in which you would have been employed had there been

PAGE 38

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
no interruption for military service, if you are qualified to perform that job. If you
are not qualified to perform that job, reasonable accommodation should be
provided to help qualify you. If this reasonable accommodation fails, you will be
reinstated to the position you held prior to taking military leave.

If you return following more than 90 days of military service, you will be re-
employed in the position in which you would have been employed had there been

no interruption for military service, or in a position of equal seniority, pay and
status provided you are qualified to perform one of those jobs. If you are not
qualified to perform that job, reasonable accommodation should be made to help
qualify you. If this reasonable accommodation fails, you will be reinstated to the
position you held prior to taking military leave.
You will not be reinstated if any of the following occur:
● The circumstances of Rouxbe have changed so that re-employment is
impossible or unreasonable.
● Your employment prior to the military leave was for a brief, non-recurrent
period with no reasonable expectation that the employment would continue
indefinitely or for a significant period.

Benefits Upon Return to Work
Time spent while in uniformed service will be treated as covered services for the
purposes of seniority, 401(k) eligibility and vesting, and benefit accrual purposes.
Time spent on uniformed services will also be treated as time worked for purposes
of determining eligibility under FMLA.
Disability
Rouxbe will reasonably accommodate an employee who returns from a military
leave with a disability incurred in or aggravated during military service, to the
extent covered by law.

PAGE 39

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
Additional information regarding military leaves may be obtained from the
Controller.
4.5 HONORING OUR MILITARY TEAM MEMBERS: LEAVE AND
RETURN POLICY
Our Commitment to Those Who Serve
At Rouxbe, we deeply value the courage and sacrifice of our team members who
serve in the military. We recognize that your commitment to defend our freedom
represents the highest form of public service. This policy outlines how we support
your military service while protecting your career path with us.
Supporting Your Service
In accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Act
(USERRA), we proudly provide necessary time off for any employee serving in the
uniformed services, including:
Active duty
Active duty for training
Initial active duty for training
Inactive duty training
Full-time National Guard duty
We ask that you share your military orders with your supervisor as early as
possible before your departure, understanding that military necessity may
sometimes make advance notice impossible. Please also notify both your
supervisor and the Controller about your intended return timeline.
While military leave is typically unpaid (except where state law requires
otherwise), you may choose to use your accrued PTO during this period. For our
exempt team members, we provide paid time off when necessary to comply with
wage and hour laws. Your benefits will continue to accrue during your service
period in accordance with applicable laws.
Welcoming You Home

PAGE 40

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
Your return to Rouxbe is important to us. The timeline for requesting
reinstatement depends on your length of service:
Service of 30 days or less:
Report for work by the first regular workday that occurs at least eight hours after
returning to your residence. If circumstances beyond your control prevent
meeting this deadline, report as soon as reasonably possible
Service of 31-180 days:
Submit an oral or written application for re-employment within 14 days of
completing service. If circumstances beyond your control prevent meeting this
deadline, apply on the next reasonably possible day
Service of more than 180 days:
Submit an oral or written application for re-employment within 90 days of
completing service.
Your Reinstatement Rights
Upon completing your military service, you'll be reinstated with all the rights and
benefits you would have earned with continuous employment. Your position upon
return will be determined as follows:
Following 90 or fewer days of service:
You'll return to the position you would have held had your employment not been
interrupted. If additional qualifications are needed, we'll provide reasonable
accommodation to help you meet them. If accommodation isn't successful, you'll
return to your previous position.
Following more than 90 days of service:
You'll return to the position you would have held without interruption, or a
position of equal seniority, pay, and status. We'll provide reasonable
accommodation if additional qualifications are needed. If accommodation isn't
successful, you'll return to your previous position
Reinstatement may not be possible only if:

PAGE 41

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
Rouxbe's circumstances have changed, making re-employment impossible or
unreasonable. Your pre-service employment was brief and temporary with no
reasonable expectation of continuing indefinitely
Preserving Your Benefits
We value your service and ensure your time away doesn't affect your standing at
Rouxbe:
• Your military service counts toward seniority, 401(k) eligibility and vesting,
and benefit accruals
• This time also counts toward FMLA eligibility
• If you return with a disability incurred or aggravated during service, we will
provide reasonable accommodation as required by law
For additional information or support regarding military leave, please contact the
Controller, who serves as our dedicated resource for military-related employment
matters.
Thank you for your service – we're honored to support you both during your
military duties and upon your return to our team. During a period of military
conflict, Rouxbe provides eligible employees with up to fifteen (15) days of unpaid
leave to be with their military spouse who is notified of an impending call or order
to active duty, or who has been authorized for leave from deployment.
To be eligible for this benefit, you must be employed an average of twenty (20) or
more hours per week. You must notify your direct supervisor of your intention to
take the leave under this policy within five (5) business days following receipt of
the official military notice.
Health insurance benefits may continue at the level and conditions as provided
under applicable laws. Upon the completion of your leave, you may return to your
original position or an equivalent job.

PAGE 42

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
4.6 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY
In accordance with appropriate federal and state family and medical leave laws,
Rouxbe provides all full-time employees up to 12-weeks of unpaid leave during a
12-month period to care for a newborn or newly- adopted/foster child, to care for
a spouse or domestic partner, child or parent with a serious health condition, or
for your own serious health condition when you are unable to perform the
functions of your job. A “serious health condition” is an illness, injury or other
physical or mental condition that involves an overnight stay in a medical care
facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider, e.g., more than 3-
consecutive days absent, chronic conditions, etc.
Under the federal the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”), leave under this
policy also may be taken for a “qualifying exigency” when your spouse, son,
daughter, or parent is on or called to active duty in support of the U.S. Armed
Forces from the Reserves, National Guard or from retirement, or for reasons
relating to an active-duty service member. Leave may be used in a consecutive
block, or intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary
or otherwise approved by Rouxbe.
The 12-month period for determining family or medical leave entitlement is
calculated from the first day leave is taken looking forward 12-months.
To be eligible for this leave benefit, you must be employed for a minimum of 12
months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately
preceding the requested leave and be located at a site with at least 50 employees,
or collectively within a 75-mile radius. You are required to give a minimum 30-day
written notice requesting leave for reasons of birth, adoption/foster placement, or
planned medical treatment for serious health conditions. Whenever 30-day notice
is not possible, you are required to inform Rouxbe as soon as practicable by
notifying HR.
Rouxbe requires you to apply all your applicable paid leave benefits, e.g., vacation,
sick leave, while initially on leave under this policy, and before such time off is
designated as unpaid. Your health insurance benefits will continue during your
absence at the same level and conditions as if you were continuing to work, and

PAGE 43

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
until such time that your leave ends or you inform Rouxbe that you will not return
to work, whichever occurs first. You remain responsible for any premium amounts
normally contributed toward your health care coverage, including dependent
coverage.
Rouxbe may require certification of your need for leave, a fitness-for-duty
certification prior to your return to work, and/or other medical re-verifications,
where applicable.
Upon the completion of your leave under this policy, you will be restored to your
former position or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other
conditions and privileges of employment.
If you are the spouse, child, parent or next of kin of a military service member who
has a serious illness or injury from active-duty service, Rouxbe provides up to 26-
weeks of leave under the federal FMLA while the service member is undergoing
medical treatment, recuperation, therapy, or is otherwise in outpatient status, or
on the temporary disability retired list. This form of leave also applies to eligible
family members of veterans for up to five years after the veteran leaves service for
a serious illness or injury incurred during active duty. This 26-week maximum is
available only during a single 12-month period starting from the first day that such
leave is taken and is combined with other FMLA leaves taken during the same
period, i.e., not offered in addition to other FMLA leave periods.
Rouxbe will notify you about your eligibility and designation of approved leave
under this policy.
Available leave under this policy may be taken in addition to the actual time
period a woman may need for time off due to her temporary disability related to
pregnancy or childbirth. Approved time off to care for domestic partners will not
count under the federal FMLA, because the FMLA does not include domestic
partners in the definition of immediate family members. This form of leave relates
only to coverage under the State Family Leave Act. Approved time off to care for

same-sex spouses will count under the FMLA, because the FMLA includes same-
sex spouses in the definition of spouse.

PAGE 44

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
Please contact the Controller with any questions or need for more information
about this policy.

4.7 MATERNITY LEAVE
For US Team Members

An eligible pregnant worker is also entitled to use her 12-week Family and Medical
Leave (FMLA) entitlement for prenatal care and for time off from work due to a
“serious medical condition or to care for a newborn” and for “bonding time” with the
new baby. The FMLA leave must be taken within 12 months of the birth of her child.
Rouxbe will pay the first 6 weeks of a qualified FMLA event for the birth of a baby. The
remainder of the FMLA leave is unpaid. This policy will be administered according to
any applicable state and federal law. It is recommended that each employee
determine the implications of using the applicable disability or benefit program
available in their state of residence and make the best choice in deciding their
individual situations. (Some states, such as Washington, also provide paid sick time in
excess of these benefits and will be factored into available leave compensation
calculations.)
Employees should contact the Controller with questions about these available leave
benefits.
Pregnancy & Parental Leave (For Canadian employees)
Rouxbe recognizes that the birth or adoption of a child is a significant event and
several leaves of absence are permitted depending on the individual’s involvement in
the process.
Rouxbe will pay the first 6 weeks of a qualified event for the birth of a baby. The
Company does not remunerate for additional times on these leaves; financial
assistance is available through the federal Employment Insurance program.
Pregnancy Leave: As per the BC Employment Standards Act, the Company grants
maternity leave of 17 weeks without pay to all female employees. Employees who are
going on pregnancy leave must provide a doctor’s certificate certifying pregnancy.
Pregnancy leave may be taken any time during the period that begins 11 weeks prior
to the expected date of delivery and ends 17 weeks after the actual delivery date. The
pregnancy leave may commence as late as the employee wishes providing that she is

PAGE 45

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
physically able to do her job.

Responsibility - Pregnancy and Parental Leave Notice
Employees are requested to inform their Manager/Supervisor, in writing, at least
four weeks prior to the commencement of either pregnancy or parental leave,
notifying the Company of the intended length of the leave.

Benefits will continue during pregnancy and parental leave. The employee’s
benefit premiums are to be paid by post-dated checks for the duration of the
leave.

Please provide as much notice as possible of your return (at least 4 weeks).
Employees who take pregnancy and parental leave will be reinstated to his/her
former position or be given a comparable position in the same location and with
the same wages and benefits, provided they return within the stated periods.
Rouxbe is not obligated to keep a position open for you beyond the pregnancy and
parental leave periods.

4.8 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LEAVE
Employees may take reasonable leave from work, work a reduced schedule or
take intermittent leave from work to take care of legal or law enforcement needs
or obtain medical treatment, mental health counseling or social services
assistance when employees or their family members are victims of domestic
violence, sexual assault or stalking. Employees taking this leave may use any
available paid time off (sick leave, vacation, etc.) while on this leave. On request,
the employee may be required to provide verification of the need for the leave.
For the purposes of this policy, “family member” includes child, spouse, domestic
partner, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, or person whom the employee is
dating.
4.9 PARENTAL LEAVE

PAGE 46

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
US Team Members
Full time employees who are spouses of parents giving birth are eligible for Parental
Leave after completing 6 months of employment. You are eligible for up to two weeks
of paid leave for the birth. Both parents are eligible for this leave for the adoption of a
child. The request must be submitted and approved by your supervisor at least 4
weeks prior to taking the leave. This leave is concurrent with any other leave that is
required under state or federal law.
Canadian Team Members
Full time employees who are spouses of parents giving birth are eligible for Parental
Leave after completing 6 months of employment. You are eligible for up to two weeks
of paid leave for the birth. Both parents are eligible for this leave for the adoption of a
child. The request must be submitted and approved by your supervisor at least 4
weeks prior to taking the leave. This leave is concurrent with any other leave that is
required under state or federal law. Every employee is entitled to additional parental
leave without pay. Either parent of a newborn child, or the individual who adopts a
child, is eligible for the leave. Parental benefits can be claimed by one parent or
shared between the two partners but must not exceed a combined maximum of 35
weeks. This leave may only be taken during the 52-week period beginning on the day
on which the child is born or comes into the care of the employee. The total duration
of the pregnancy and the parental leave must not exceed 52 weeks.
4.10 PERSONAL LEAVE
Requests for unpaid leave of absence must be submitted in writing to your
manager, giving as much advance notice as possible. If your request is to combine
an unpaid leave of absence with vacation days, the vacation must be used before
the leave of absence.
4.11 CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS
Upon separation from employment, or if you experience a reduction in hours of
employment, you may be eligible to continue to receive your current level of
health benefits at your own cost for a period of up to 18 months. Information
about unemployment insurance can be obtained from the Controller. If your
spouse and/or dependents are covered under the plan at the time of your
termination or reduction they would also be eligible for this coverage.
4.12 WORKERS' COMPENSATION

PAGE 47

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
On-the-job injuries are covered by our Workers' Compensation insurance policy
(WorksafeBC in BC). This insurance is provided at no cost to you. If you are injured
on the job, no matter how slightly, report the incident immediately to your
supervisor and/or the Controller. We ask for your assistance in alerting
management to any condition which could lead or contribute to an employee
accident. Worker’s Compensation insurance does not cover you for injuries that
occur during your voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or
athletic activity that is not part of your work-related activities even if sponsored by
Rouxbe.
Additionally, we will attempt to provide reasonable accommodation, which is
medically necessary, feasible and does not impose an undue hardship on us as
prescribed by applicable federal, state or Provincial law.
4.13 401(k) QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLAN
Rouxbe provides eligible US based employees with a 401(k) Qualified Retirement
Plan which is an excellent means of long-term savings for your retirement. The
employer’s contribution, if any, is determined by Rouxbe on an annual basis.
All employees who are hired must meet certain eligibility requirements to
participate in the 401(k) plan. An employee must work for the Company for 90
days and be at least 18 years old to be eligible. Once the time and age
requirements have been met, the employee can begin to participate on the next
plan entry date, which is the first day of the month. The employee may contribute
up to 100% of pre-tax or post-tax earnings through automatic payment deferrals.
All contributions are subject to the annual dollar maximum set by the IRS each
year.
The Company offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in our 401(k)
retirement savings plan. While the Company currently provides
matching contributions to employee 401(k) accounts, the Company
reserves the sole and absolute discretion to determine the amount,
timing, and continuation of any matching contributions. The Company
may modify, reduce, suspend, or eliminate matching contributions at
any time, for any reason, without prior notice. Matching contribution

PAGE 48

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25

decisions will be made based on business needs, financial
considerations, and other factors as determined by Company
management. Participation in the 401(k) plan and any associated
Company matching contributions should not be considered a guarantee
or entitlement. Employees should refer to the current Summary Plan

PAGE 57

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
the customer, please notify your supervisor. When discussing such an error, be
certain of the mistake and be tactful in rectifying the problem.

irregular practice on the part of the customer or customer personnel, please
inform your direct manager immediately. Under no circumstances should you
discuss the matter with the customer or customer personnel.
5.4 ATTENDANCE
Attendance is an important factor for your success with Rouxbe. We work as a
team and have many customers relying on our assistance. If you are going to be
absent or late for work, it is your responsibility to notify your supervisor.
If your supervisor is not available when you call or text, please make sure you
leave a message to ensure that they have been informed. If you are physically
unable to make the call, make sure to have someone else make the call in your
place. For any absences longer than three days, Rouxbe may request a written
release from your doctor to allow you back at work.
Personal issues requiring time away from your work, such as doctor's
appointments or other matters, should be scheduled during your non-working
hours if possible.

have voluntarily abandoned your position with Rouxbe, and you may be
terminated from employment. If you cannot reach your direct supervisor, please
contact the Controller or CEO.
If you appear to be sick while at work, your supervisor or manager has the ability
to send you home as not to risk the spread of contagious germs. Employees are
eligible to use PTO to make up for non-working hours due to sickness.
5.5 WORKWEEK AND WORK HOURS
Designing Your Professional Rhythm

PAGE 58

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
At Rouxbe, we recognize that excellence thrives when you can align your work
schedule with your personal life. Our standard work week for full-time employees
is 40 hours, but we've designed a framework that puts you in control of how those
hours unfold.
Your Flexible Options
We trust you to manage your schedule within our collaborative framework. Many
of our team members have found success with compressed schedules, such as
four 10-hour days with Friday as a flex day. To support this flexibility, we typically
avoid scheduling internal meetings on Fridays.
Honoring Your Time Management
As a full-time exempt employee, we respect your judgment about when additional
hours might be necessary to complete important projects. We equally support
your choice to work outside standard business hours when it suits your
productivity style and personal commitments.
Balancing Flexibility with Connection
While we embrace flexibility, we also value the moments when we come together.
We ask that you prioritize team gatherings, scheduled meetings, team retreats,
and other collaborative events that strengthen our community and advance our
shared goals.
Our Trust in You
This approach reflects our confidence in your professionalism and commitment.
By giving you greater control over when and how you work, we believe you'll
create your optimal balance of focused productivity and personal fulfillment,
ultimately delivering your best contributions to our mission while thriving in all
aspects of your life.

and productivity. For our non-exempt team members, we provide a minimum 30-
minute unpaid meal break during each 8-hour workday, in accordance with

PAGE 59

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
applicable laws and regulations.
Coordinating Your Break Time
To ensure smooth workflow and coverage for our customers, your supervisor will
work with you to schedule your meal periods at appropriate times throughout the
day. We encourage you to step away from your workspace during this time to
enjoy a proper break and return refreshed.
The Value of Disconnecting
These dedicated break periods aren't just a legal requirement - they're an
investment in your health and effectiveness. By taking time to nourish yourself
and briefly disconnect from work responsibilities, you'll bring renewed energy and
focus to your role.
Your supervisor is available to address any questions about scheduling your meal
breaks or to help accommodate specific needs while ensuring coverage during our
business hours.
5.7 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
Each employee has an obligation to observe and follow Rouxbe's policies and to
always maintain proper standards of conduct. If your behavior interferes with the
orderly and efficient operation of a department, corrective disciplinary measures
will be taken. Certain major offenses may result in immediate disciplinary action
which may include a verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without
pay, and/or termination. The appropriate disciplinary action imposed will be
determined by Rouxbe. We do not guarantee that one form of action will
necessarily precede another.
In order to avoid such severe consequences, follow common sense and avoid
major offenses such as, but not limited to, the following: violation of our policies

can be modified at any time. We emphasize that termination decisions will be
based on an assessment of all relevant factors.
Nothing in this policy is designed to modify our employment-at-will policy.

request to the Controller if you would like to review your file. You are not
permitted to remove or alter any documents from your personnel files. If you
disagree with a document in the file, you may place a statement in the file.
Personnel files exclude information relating to a criminal investigation and records
compiled in preparation for an impending lawsuit that would not be available to
another party.

employee of another employee is prohibited while either person is on work time.

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25

quickly for business expenses. By following these simple guidelines, you
can manage your work-related purchases with confidence.

Before You Purchase

to incur. This pre-approval ensures that your purchase aligns with our
business needs and budget guidelines.

mind:

System within 30 calendar days of purchase to ensure reimbursement
• Receipt Documentation: Always attach receipts to your expense reports, this
documentation is essential for processing your reimbursement
Step-by-Step Reimbursement Process
To make reimbursement as efficient as possible:
• Use the expense report detail template (available in the Rouxbe Dropbox) to
list your expenses on a weekly or monthly basis
• Submit the completed template to your direct manager for approval
• Once approved, your manager will forward the expense report to
accounting@rouxbe.com
• Ensure all expenses have corresponding receipts attached
• Expect reimbursement within one week after your approved report reaches the
accounting team

Safety can only be achieved through teamwork at Rouxbe. Our goal is to have no
work-related injuries or illnesses and to provide a safe and healthy working
environment for all of our employees. Each employee, supervisor and manager
must practice safety awareness by thinking defensively, anticipating unsafe
situations and reporting unsafe conditions immediately to your direct supervisor
or another member of the Management.
Please observe the following precautions:
● Notify your supervisor of any emergency situation.
● Report all accidents, however minor, and regardless of any physical injury.
● The unauthorized use of alcoholic beverages, marijuana or illegal substances
during working hours will not be tolerated. The possession of illegal
substances on the Company's property is forbidden.

qualified.
● Know the proper lifting procedures. Get help when lifting or pushing heavy
objects.
● Understand your job fully and follow instructions. If you are not sure of the
safe procedure, don't guess; just ask your supervisor.

lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
6.2 WORKPLACE VIOLENCE
Violence or threats of violence by an employee or anyone else against an
employee, supervisor or member of management will not be tolerated. Despite
being mostly, a virtual organization with limited physical interaction on a daily
basis for most, workplace violence is still an important matter, especially as it
pertains to verbal abuse. The purpose of this policy is to minimize the potential
risk of personal injuries to you at work and to reduce the possibility of damage to
our property in the event someone, for whatever reason, may be unhappy with a
Rouxbe decision or action by an employee or member of management. We are
committed to working with our employees to maintain a work environment free
from violence, threats of violence, harassment, intimidation, and other disruptive
behavior. Such behavior can include oral or written statements, gestures, or
expressions that communicate a direct or indirect threat of physical harm.
If you receive or overhear any threatening communications from an employee or
outside third party, report it to your supervisor at once. Do not engage in either
physical or verbal confrontation with a potentially violent individual. If you
encounter an individual who is threatening immediate harm to an employee or
visitor to our premises, contact an emergency agency (such as 911) immediately.
All reports of work-related threats will be kept confidential to the extent possible,
investigated and documented. Employees are expected to report and participate
in an investigation of any suspected or actual cases of workplace violence.
Violations of this policy, including your failure to report or fully cooperate in
Rouxbe's investigation, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
immediate termination.

PAGE 68

workplace, immediately provide a copy of the order to the Controller or your

Rouxbe business is forbidden except where expressly authorized by Rouxbe and
permitted by state and local laws. This policy applies to all employees, regardless
of whether or not they have a valid permit to carry a firearm.

required to report such instances to the Controller or CEO immediately. Violations
of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

6.4 DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY
Rouxbe has vital interests in ensuring a safe, healthy and efficient working
environment for our employees, their co-workers and the customers we serve.
The unlawful or improper presence or use of controlled substances or alcohol in
the workplace presents a serious safety and health risk not only to the user, but to
all those who work or come into contact with the user. For these reasons, we have
established as a condition of employment and continued employment with
Rouxbe the following substance abuse policy.
You are prohibited from reporting to work or working while using illegal or
unauthorized substances. Illegal substance means any substance defined as illegal
under state and/or federal law. You are prohibited from reporting to work or
working when you use any controlled substance, except when the use is pursuant
to a doctor's orders and the doctor advises you that the substance does not
adversely affect your ability to safely perform his or her job duties.

PAGE 69

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
In addition, you are prohibited from engaging in unlawful or unauthorized
manufacture, distribution, sale, possession or use of illegal substances and alcohol
including on our paid time, on our premises, or while engaged in our activities. You
are also prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty with any alcohol
in your system. You are also prohibited from consuming alcohol during working
hours, including meal and break periods. Although some States have legalized
marijuana for medicinal and/or recreational purposes, Rouxbe is not required to
allow the medicinal or recreational use of marijuana in the workplace. Marijuana
use or being under the influence is strictly prohibited on Rouxbe property and
while conducting Rouxbe business.
The only exception to this general rule is that an employee who is at least 21 years
old may consume alcoholic beverages in moderation while voluntarily attending
Company-hosted social functions that occur on or off the premises after normal
working hours, provided that you are not performing work for us at the time of
alcoholic consumption. Under no circumstances should you consume alcohol to
the point of being intoxicated at such events.
Your employment or continued employment with us is conditional upon your full
compliance with the foregoing substance abuse policy. Any violation of this policy
may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Furthermore,
any employee who violates this policy who is subject to termination may be
permitted in lieu of termination, at Rouxbe's sole discretion, to participate in and
successfully complete an appropriate treatment, counseling or rehabilitation
program as recommended by a substance abuse professional as a condition of
continued employment and in accordance with applicable federal, state or
provincial laws.

Consistent with its fair employment policy, we maintain a policy of non-
discrimination and reasonable accommodation with respect to recovering addicts

and alcoholics, and those having a medical history reflecting treatment for
substance abuse conditions. We encourage you to seek assistance before your
substance or alcohol use renders you unable to perform your essential job
functions or jeopardizes the health and safety of yourself or others.

PAGE 70

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
We further reserve the right to take any and all appropriate and lawful actions
necessary to enforce this substance abuse policy. Rouxbe also reserves the right to
test employees for violations of this policy on a post-accident, reasonable
suspicion, or other basis.
This policy represents management guidelines only and should not be interpreted
as a contract of employment.
Prescription Drugs
The legal use of controlled substances, such as prescription drugs prescribed by a
licensed physician, or over-the-counter medications is permitted. However, if you
appear unable to perform your job duties satisfactorily because of the use of these
medications we may require a doctor’s authorization in order to come back to
work. Please notify the Controller if any prescription medication may interfere
with your performance.
6.5 PRIVACY COMMITTMENT
At Rouxbe we have a long-standing practice of protecting the privacy of our
employees in all of our business operations. The Rouxbe Privacy practices
summarized below are designed to ensure that all your personal information will
continue to be protected.
The BC Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) sets out rules for how
organizations can collect, use and disclose employee’s personal information. We
have developed our Rouxbe Privacy Policy to comply with PIPA and are committed
to being accountable in the treatment of personal information and for the
principles outlined in this policy.
Every organization subject to PIPA must have a Privacy Officer. The Rouxbe Privacy
Officer is the CTO with copy to the Controller.
Personal Information
Personal information means information about an identifiable individual, such as
someone’s name, home address, social insurance number, sex, income or family
status.

PAGE 71

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
Employee personal information is information that is collected, used or disclosed
solely for the purposes reasonably required to establish, maintain, manage or
terminate an employment relationship between an employee and Rouxbe. This
includes information such as name, home address, educational history and
employment history. This does not include contact information or work product
information (see below).
Contact information means information that allows an individual to be contacted
at work. It includes the name, position name or title, business telephone number,
business address, business email and business fax number for the individual.
Work product information is information that is prepared or collected by an
employee as part of that individual’s work responsibilities but does not include
information about an individual who did not prepare or collect the information.
General Purpose
Our two general purposes for collecting personal information are:
1. To manage and develop our business and operations, including personnel
and employment matters; and
2. To meet legal and regulatory requirements.
These two general purposes include the following specific purposes for which we
collect personal information about employees:
a. To manage, develop and retain a highly skilled, professional, and
productive workforce that produces our business success. For example, we
collect personal information about employees making staffing and employee
development decisions, to measure and reward performance, and to assess
our human resources to meet our business objectives.
b. To administer compensation, benefits, incentive and departure programs.
For example, we collect and record personal information to manage our

PAGE 72

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
compensation and benefits programs.
c. To provide a safe and respectful workplace as required by law and Rouxbe
policies. For example, we keep records of safety incidents, hazardous
occurrences, accidents, and injury reports to provide a safe work
environment and comply with the law.
d. To protect and manage corporate assets. Use of network services are
logged (voice, email and Internet) and video surveillance is used in some
building locations with the primary objective of enhancing employee and
property security.
e. To meet legal and regulatory requirements. We are required to collect
certain information such as a social insurance number for Canada Revenue
Agency payroll purposes. We would collect information in response to a
court order or any government-required reporting.
Disclosure of Personal Information
There are a variety of circumstances in which we disclose some personal
information about employees to outside parties. The following are some
examples:
a. Employee information collected in one Rouxbe business unit may be shared
with other Rouxbe business units for the purposes identified above and is
limited to the minimal information necessary.
b. To administer compensation, benefits, pension and termination/severance
programs, we disclose employee information to financial institutions,
insurance providers, government departments and agencies such as the
Canada Revenue Agency or outplacement services.
c. To WorksafeBC for injury claims.
d. For staffing and retention purposes, personal information may be provided
to consulting, compensation research and analysis, recruiting, or executive

PAGE 73

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
search firms. In some circumstances, employee resume data may be
disclosed to specific business customers when Rouxbe is bidding on work.
e. When required by law, or contractual obligations, we may disclose employee
personal information to agencies including the Employment Standards
Branch, WorksafeBC, creditors, the Privacy Commissioner or the B.C. Human
Rights Tribunal.
Protection of Personal Information
In order to protect your personal information and your right to privacy, Rouxbe
will:
a. Not collect, use or disclose your personal information to anyone outside the
organization for anything other than a legitimate business purpose or legal
requirement, except with your consent except where it is legally authorized
or required by law to do so without consent.
b. Protect your personal information with appropriate security safeguards
c. Protect the confidentiality of your personal information when dealing with
other companies
d. Keep your personal information as accurate and up to date as is necessary
for the purposes identified above.
e. Respond to any request you may make for access to your personal
information. In certain exceptional situations, Rouxbe may not be able to
provide access to all the personal information that it holds about an
employee. If access cannot be provided, Rouxbe will provide the reason for
denying access.
Employee Consent
The acceptance of employment and benefits by an employee is viewed as consent
for Rouxbe to collect, use, and disclose personal information about the employee

PAGE 74

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
for the purposes identified above.
The new privacy legislation gives employees the right to withdraw consent, at any
time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. This right
protects employees from having their personal information collected
unnecessarily or for an unreasonable purpose.
Rouxbe views the purposes identified as reasonable and necessary to manage our
business effectively. Therefore, Rouxbe will continue to collect, use and disclose
personal information for these purposes.
Employees are considered to have given implied consent when Rouxbe’s purpose
for collecting, using or disclosing personal information would be considered
obvious and the employee voluntarily provides personal information for that
obvious purpose. In the case of employee personal information, PIPA allows
Rouxbe to collect, use or disclose employee personal information without consent
if it is reasonable for the purposes of establishing, managing or terminating an
employment relationship between Rouxbe and the employee. In such cases, PIPA
requires Rouxbe to notify employees of the collection, use or disclosure.
Retaining Personal Information
Rouxbe will keep personal information used to make a decision that directly
affects employees for at least one year after we make that decision (or as required
by PIPA). Rouxbe will only retain personal information for as long as necessary to
fulfill the identified purposes or as long as required for a legal or business purpose.
Accuracy of Personal Information
Rouxbe will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information we
collect, use or disclose is accurate and complete. Employees may request the
correction of any errors or omissions in their personal information under Rouxbe’s
control. Upon receiving the new information, the employee’s personal information
will be updated as soon as reasonably possible.
Employee Access to Personal Information
Employees have the right to access their personal information under Rouxbe’s

PAGE 75

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25
custody or control. Rouxbe will give employees their personal information and
inform them about the ways in which their information is or has been used, and
the names of the individuals and organizations to which their personal information
has been disclosed. In some cases, Rouxbe may not give an employee access to
certain personal information where authorized or required by PIPA to refuse
access.
Employees of Rouxbe may complain about the treatment of their personal
information directly to the Controller or, if not satisfied with the response, they
may complain to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for
British Columbia.
To Find out More Information
If you have any questions or concerns about Rouxbe’s privacy practices, you can
talk to the Privacy Officer or Controller.
6.6 BULLYING

Bullying is not acceptable or tolerated at Rouxbe. All workers will be treated in a
fair and respectful manner. This policy applies to all employees, including
permanent, temporary, casual, contract, and student workers. It also applies to
interpersonal and electronic communications, such as email. Employees at Rouxbe
must not engage in the bullying of other employees. Employees must report if
bullying is observed or experienced and must comply with this policy.
Bullying
“Bullying” means a single significant incident or a pattern of incidents involving
written, verbal, or electronic communication, or a physical act or gesture, or any
combination thereof, directed at another co-worker which:

co-worker’s actual or perceived personal characteristics, behaviors, or beliefs, or
motivated by the co-worker's association with another person and based on the
other person's characteristics, behaviors, or beliefs.
“Cyberbullying” means conduct as defined above undertaken using electronic
devices. “Electronic devices” include, but are not limited to, telephones, cellular
phones, computers, pagers, electronic mail, instant messaging, text messaging,
and websites.
“Bullying” does not include any reasonable action taken by Rouxbe or a
manager/supervisor relating to the management and direction of workers or the
place of employment.
Managers/Supervisors who fail to take appropriate corrective action when made
aware of bullying of an employee will themselves be subject to disciplinary action.
Those against whom a complaint is found to have substance will be subject to
immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Reporting
Incidents or complaints should be reported as soon as possible after experiencing
or witnessing an incident. This allows the incident to be investigated and
addressed promptly.
Employees can report incidents or complaints of workplace bullying verbally or in
writing to their Manager/Supervisor. When submitting a written complaint, please
use the workplace bullying complaint form. If the complaint is against your
Manager/Supervisor, report the incident to the Controller or COO.
Provide as much information as possible in the report, such as the names of
people involved, witnesses, where the events occurred, when they occurred, and
what behavior and/or words led to the complaint. Attach any supporting
documents, such as emails, handwritten notes, or photographs. Physical evidence,
such as vandalized personal belongings, can also be submitted.

is an important strategy for our people as well as our business development. The
Company encourages employee learning and growth to develop their maximum
personal and occupational potential through participation in training and
development activities.
Effective training and development programs reflect a match between the
organization’s goals for improved results and return on investment and employee
goals for skills and personal growth and opportunities for future advancement.
Manager/Supervisors will provide advice and guidance to help their staff further
their careers and thereby raise the level of motivation, job satisfaction and
performance in their departments. Inter-departmental and intra-departmental
cross training is encouraged.

into a product or process an Invention not covered by Section 4(a) of this Agreement in
