5.10 CHANGES IN PERSONAL DATA

To aid you and/or your family in matters of personal emergency, we need to
maintain up-to-date information. Changes in name, address, telephone number,
marital status, number of dependents or changes in next of kin and/or
beneficiaries must be made by email to the Controller at accounting@rouxbe.com.
For Officers or Board Members of the Company, it is imperative that you inform
the Controller or CEO if any address changes occur. BOIC requirements are in place
and involve heavy fines to the organization if current addresses are not accurate.
