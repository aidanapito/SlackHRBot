quickly for business expenses. By following these simple guidelines, you
can manage your work-related purchases with confidence.
Before You Purchase
The key to successful reimbursement starts before you make a purchase. Simply
secure approval from your supervisor for any business expense you plan
to incur. This pre-approval ensures that your purchase aligns with our
business needs and budget guidelines.
Submitting Your Expenses
After making an approved purchase, you have two important timeframes to keep in
mind:
• 30-Day Submission Window: Submit your expense report in the Account
System within 30 calendar days of purchase to ensure reimbursement
• Receipt Documentation: Always attach receipts to your expense reports, this
documentation is essential for processing your reimbursement
Step-by-Step Reimbursement Process
To make reimbursement as efficient as possible:
• Use the expense report detail template (available in the Rouxbe Dropbox) to
list your expenses on a weekly or monthly basis
• Submit the completed template to your direct manager for approval
• Once approved, your manager will forward the expense report to
accounting@rouxbe.com
• Ensure all expenses have corresponding receipts attached
• Expect reimbursement within one week after your approved report reaches the
accounting team
