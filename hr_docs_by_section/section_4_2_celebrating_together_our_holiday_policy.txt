4.2 CELEBRATING TOGETHER: OUR HOLIDAY POLICY

Honoring Time to Refresh and Reconnect
At Rouxbe, we believe that quality time away from work is essential for creativity,
wellbeing, and bringing your best self to our shared mission. Our holiday policy
reflects our commitment to supporting your work-life harmony while maintaining
our service excellence.
Your Holiday Benefits
We're pleased to welcome you to our holiday benefits program from day one! As a
full-time non-exempt team member, you'll begin enjoying paid holidays
immediately upon joining our team, no waiting period required.

For our full-time exempt colleagues, we provide holiday pay in complete alignment
with federal, state, and provincial wage and hour regulations, ensuring you can fully
disconnect and enjoy these important occasions.
Special Considerations for Government Project Teams
We recognize the unique nature of government partnerships. If you're contributing
to U.S. Government initiatives such as DoDEA or MSC projects, your holiday
schedule will follow the federal guidelines specific to your project. This ensures
seamless coordination with our government partners while honoring public service
holiday traditions.
Our Collective Celebration
Holidays represent more than just time away, they're opportunities to celebrate,
recharge, and return with renewed energy for the important work we do together.
We encourage you to fully embrace these moments, knowing that taking time to
rest contributes to our shared success and innovation.
Should you have any questions about how our holiday policy applies to your specific
role or situation, please don't hesitate to contact your manager or our HR team.
We're here to support your well-being both during working hours and as you enjoy
a well-deserved time off.
