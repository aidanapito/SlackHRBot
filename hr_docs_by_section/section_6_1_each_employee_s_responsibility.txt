6.1 EACH EMPLOYEE'S RESPONSIBILITY

Safety can only be achieved through teamwork at Rouxbe. Our goal is to have no
work-related injuries or illnesses and to provide a safe and healthy working
environment for all of our employees. Each employee, supervisor and manager
must practice safety awareness by thinking defensively, anticipating unsafe
situations and reporting unsafe conditions immediately to your direct supervisor
or another member of the Management.
Please observe the following precautions:
● Notify your supervisor of any emergency situation.
● Report all accidents, however minor, and regardless of any physical injury.
● The unauthorized use of alcoholic beverages, marijuana or illegal substances
during working hours will not be tolerated. The possession of illegal
substances on the Company's property is forbidden.

● Use, adjust and repair machines and equipment only if you are trained and
qualified.
● Know the proper lifting procedures. Get help when lifting or pushing heavy
objects.
● Understand your job fully and follow instructions. If you are not sure of the
safe procedure, don't guess; just ask your supervisor.
● A violation of safety precautions is in itself an unsafe act. A violation may
lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
