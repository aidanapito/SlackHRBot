MEDIA GUIDELINES
Embracing the Connected World Together
At Rouxbe, we recognize social media as a powerful extension of our personal and
professional lives. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn have become
essential communication channels for many of us, and we fully support your active
participation in these digital communities.
Your Role as a Digital Ambassador
When you identify as a Rouxbe team member online, you become a valued voice
of our brand. Your online presence can create meaningful connections and
showcase the innovative spirit that drives our company. We trust you to represent
both yourself and Rouxbe with authenticity and integrity, knowing that your digital
footprint reflects our shared values.
Guiding Principles for Digital Engagement
We believe in your judgment and offer these guidelines to help navigate the
sometimes complex world of social media:

the confidentiality that powers our innovation

• Respect Our Relationships: Our partnerships with clients and collaborators
are built on trust, please obtain permission before referencing them
• Communicate with Dignity: Maintain the same respectful tone online that
you would in our physical workspace

focus on the positive impact we can create together

content and that of other organizations

situations, connect with our communications team before commenting
Creating a Respectful Digital Environment
Our commitment to a harassment-free workplace extends to all online spaces. The
same principles that guide our in-person interactions apply to digital
communications. We're dedicated to maintaining spaces free from sexually
explicit content, ethnic slurs, racial epithets, or any content that diminishes the
dignity of others.
Supporting Your Digital Success
We want you to feel confident in your online presence. If you have questions
about these guidelines or encounter situations that feel unclear, please reach out
to your manager for guidance. Together, we can build a digital presence that
strengthens our brand while honoring your individual voice.
Thank you for being thoughtful ambassadors of Rouxbe in all the spaces you
inhabit - both physical and digital.
