1.3 A WORD ABOUT THIS HANDBOOK

The provisions of the Rouxbe Employee Handbook do not create contractual
obligations with respect to any matters it covers. Nor is this Employee Handbook
intended to create a contract guaranteeing that you will be employed for any
specific time period.
This Employee Handbook refers to current benefit plans maintained by Rouxbe.
Refer to the actual plan documents or contact Rouxbe’s Controller if you have
specific questions regarding the benefit plans. The language contained in the plan
documents takes precedent.
Rouxbe’s Controller is:
Isis Kearney

Lastly, throughout this document, both the terms “Company” and “Rouxbe” have
been used, and it is important to note that they are interchangeable.
A copy of the Employee Handbook can be found in the Rouxbe sharefile.
