4.11 CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS

Upon separation from employment, or if you experience a reduction in hours of
employment, you may be eligible to continue to receive your current level of
health benefits at your own cost for a period of up to 18 months. Information
about unemployment insurance can be obtained from the Controller. If your
spouse and/or dependents are covered under the plan at the time of your
termination or reduction they would also be eligible for this coverage.
