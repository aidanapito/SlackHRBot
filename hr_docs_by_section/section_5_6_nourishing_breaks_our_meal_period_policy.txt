At Rouxbe, we believe that taking time to recharge is essential for your wellbeing
and productivity. For our non-exempt team members, we provide a minimum 30-

applicable laws and regulations.
Coordinating Your Break Time
To ensure smooth workflow and coverage for our customers, your supervisor will
work with you to schedule your meal periods at appropriate times throughout the
day. We encourage you to step away from your workspace during this time to
enjoy a proper break and return refreshed.
The Value of Disconnecting
These dedicated break periods aren't just a legal requirement - they're an
investment in your health and effectiveness. By taking time to nourish yourself
and briefly disconnect from work responsibilities, you'll bring renewed energy and
focus to your role.
Your supervisor is available to address any questions about scheduling your meal
breaks or to help accommodate specific needs while ensuring coverage during our
business hours.
