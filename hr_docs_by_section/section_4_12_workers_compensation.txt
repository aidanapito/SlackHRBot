4.12 WORKERS' COMPENSATION

PAGE 46
ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25

On-the-job injuries are covered by our Workers' Compensation insurance policy
(WorksafeBC in BC). This insurance is provided at no cost to you. If you are injured
on the job, no matter how slightly, report the incident immediately to your
supervisor and/or the Controller. We ask for your assistance in alerting
management to any condition which could lead or contribute to an employee
accident. Workerâ€™s Compensation insurance does not cover you for injuries that
occur during your voluntary participation in off-duty recreational, social, or
athletic activity that is not part of your work-related activities even if sponsored by
Rouxbe.
Additionally, we will attempt to provide reasonable accommodation, which is
medically necessary, feasible and does not impose an undue hardship on us as
prescribed by applicable federal, state or Provincial law.
