4.14 EFFECT OF TERMINATION ON THE 401(K) PLAN

In the event of termination, you may become eligible to distribute your 401(k)
funds.
● If you have a vested account balance that is equal to or less than $1000.00
and have not elected to distribute your balance within 30 days of your
termination date, the plan administrator may direct the entire vested
balance to be distributed to you. The distribution will be mailed to the last
known address Rouxbe has on file for you. (20% mandatory federal income
tax withholding may apply to the taxable portion).
● If you have a vested account balance between $1000 - $5000 and have not
elected to distribute your balance within 30 days of your termination date,
the plan administrator may direct the entire vested balance to be paid
directly to an individual retirement account (IRA) chosen by Rouxbe.
Information about this rollover will be mailed to the last known address
Rouxbe has on file for you.
