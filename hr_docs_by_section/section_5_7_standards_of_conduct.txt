5.7 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

Each employee has an obligation to observe and follow Rouxbe's policies and to
always maintain proper standards of conduct. If your behavior interferes with the
orderly and efficient operation of a department, corrective disciplinary measures
will be taken. Certain major offenses may result in immediate disciplinary action
