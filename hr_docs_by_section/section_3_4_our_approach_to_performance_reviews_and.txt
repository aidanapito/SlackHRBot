3.4 OUR APPROACH TO PERFORMANCE REVIEWS AND

COMPENSATION
Our Philosophy
At Rouxbe, we believe that meaningful growth happens through partnership, open
dialogue, and a shared commitment to excellence. Our performance review and
compensation process reflect this belief, designed not as a one-way evaluation, but as a
collaborative journey toward both individual and organizational success.
We see each team member as a vital contributor to our mission, bringing unique talents
and perspectives that strengthen our collective impact. This policy outlines how we
nurture your professional development while recognizing your contributions through
fair and thoughtful compensation practices.
The Annual Growth Conversation
Rather than traditional performance "reviews," we engage in annual Growth
Conversations. These structured yet personalized discussions create space for:
• Celebrating achievements and milestones from the past year
• Exploring opportunities for skill development and career advancement
• Setting inspiring, meaningful goals that align with both your aspirations and our
organizational vision
• Identifying resources and support needed for your continued success
These conversations take place annually near your work anniversary date, though your
manager will maintain regular check-ins throughout the year to provide ongoing
feedback and support.
Our Approach to Compensation Growth
We believe in rewarding the value you bring to our team and our learners. Our
compensation philosophy centers on:
• Transparency: Clear communication about how compensation decisions are made

• Fairness: Consistent application of compensation practices across the organization
• Market Competitiveness: Regular market analysis to ensure our compensation
remains competitive
• Recognition of Growth: Acknowledging both performance excellence and skill
development
• Organizational Context: Balancing individual recognition with our overall financial
health
Following your annual Growth Conversation, your manager will collaborate with our
leadership team to determine appropriate compensation adjustments based on:
• Your performance against established goals and expectations
• Acquisition of new skills, certifications, or capabilities that enhance your
contribution
• Expanded responsibilities or scope within your role
• Internal equity considerations
• Market conditions and company performance
Our Shared Commitment
We commit to making thoughtful, fair decisions about compensation and providing
clear explanations for those decisions. We recognize that compensation discussions can
sometimes feel uncertain or challenging, and we welcome honest, respectful dialogue
throughout this process.
We invite you to actively participate in your Growth Conversation by:
• Reflecting on your achievements and areas for development
• Sharing your career aspirations and interests
• Proposing meaningful goals that energize and inspire you
• Asking questions about how you can continue to grow and contribute
Together, we'll create a path forward that honors your contributions, supports your
growth, and strengthens our collective ability to deliver exceptional learning
experiences.
Implementation Timeline
Growth Conversations will be scheduled approximately 2 weeks before your work
anniversary date. Any approved compensation adjustments will take effect on your
anniversary date and will be reflected in the following pay period.
