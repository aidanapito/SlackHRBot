2.4 REASONABLE ACCOMODATION POLICY

Rouxbe is committed to providing equal opportunities to qualified individuals with
disabilities. We will make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or
mental disabilities of otherwise qualified employment candidates and current
employees to the extent required by applicable law.
Any employee or job applicant who requires accommodation to perform the essential
functions of their position should contact the Controller to request such
accommodation. Upon receiving an accommodation request, Rouxbe will engage in an
interactive process with the individual to identify potential reasonable accommodation
that would enable the individual to perform the essential job functions.
Rouxbe may request verification of the need for accommodation from the individual's
health care provider when appropriate. All medical information received during this
process will be treated as confidential in accordance with applicable laws.
