4.3 UNLIMITED - PAID TIME OFF (PTO)

As of December 1, 2024, Rouxbe will no longer track accrued PTO hours. Employees
are eligible for Unlimited PTO at 90 days of employment. Employees are
encouraged to take the time they need to rest and recharge, without the constraint
of a predetermined allotment of vacation or sick days.
● Minimum Time Off: While not required, we strongly recommend that

employees take at least three weeks off annually to fully disconnect and
benefit from extended breaks.
● Manager Approval: Submit PTO requests through the ADP / Justworks portal
to your direct manager as early as possible. Update the Company calendar
with your requested days off. Managers approve PTO at their discretion,
considering factors such as department needs, other team requests, and peak
coverage times.
● Coverage: Unlimited PTO encompasses sick days, vacation, bereavement,
company holidays, jury duty, birthdays, volunteer service commitments, and
any other occasions when an employee needs to step away. Please note that
this policy does not replace our separate policies addressing Military, Family,
Medical, Maternity, Domestic Violence, and Parental leave.
● PTO Requests: Employees should submit requests through the ADP/Justworks
portal and update the company calendar accordingly.
● Conflict Resolution: In situations where multiple team members from the
same department request the same time off, preference will be given to the
employee with the longest tenure.
