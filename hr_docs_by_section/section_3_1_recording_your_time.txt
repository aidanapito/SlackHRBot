3.1 RECORDING YOUR TIME

Non-exempt employees will record their time using the Just Works Self-Service
Portal. Hours should be entered daily, and any errors or fixes should be submitted
to payroll 2 days prior to the last day of the pay period or as requested by the
Payroll Department.
All employees subject to this policy are required to accurately record all-time
worked. Altering or falsifying your time records or completing another employeeâ€™s
time and attendance records, except as directed, are grounds for disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
For payroll purposes, the workweek starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.
