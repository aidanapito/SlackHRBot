4.5 HONORING OUR MILITARY TEAM MEMBERS: LEAVE AND

RETURN POLICY
Our Commitment to Those Who Serve
At Rouxbe, we deeply value the courage and sacrifice of our team members who
serve in the military. We recognize that your commitment to defend our freedom
represents the highest form of public service. This policy outlines how we support
your military service while protecting your career path with us.
Supporting Your Service
In accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Act
(USERRA), we proudly provide necessary time off for any employee serving in the
uniformed services, including:
Active duty
Active duty for training
Initial active duty for training
Inactive duty training
Full-time National Guard duty
We ask that you share your military orders with your supervisor as early as
possible before your departure, understanding that military necessity may
sometimes make advance notice impossible. Please also notify both your
supervisor and the Controller about your intended return timeline.
While military leave is typically unpaid (except where state law requires
otherwise), you may choose to use your accrued PTO during this period. For our
exempt team members, we provide paid time off when necessary to comply with
wage and hour laws. Your benefits will continue to accrue during your service
period in accordance with applicable laws.
Welcoming You Home

Your return to Rouxbe is important to us. The timeline for requesting
reinstatement depends on your length of service:
Service of 30 days or less:
Report for work by the first regular workday that occurs at least eight hours after
returning to your residence. If circumstances beyond your control prevent
meeting this deadline, report as soon as reasonably possible
Service of 31-180 days:
Submit an oral or written application for re-employment within 14 days of
completing service. If circumstances beyond your control prevent meeting this
deadline, apply on the next reasonably possible day
Service of more than 180 days:
Submit an oral or written application for re-employment within 90 days of
completing service.
Your Reinstatement Rights
Upon completing your military service, you'll be reinstated with all the rights and
benefits you would have earned with continuous employment. Your position upon
return will be determined as follows:
Following 90 or fewer days of service:
You'll return to the position you would have held had your employment not been
interrupted. If additional qualifications are needed, we'll provide reasonable
accommodation to help you meet them. If accommodation isn't successful, you'll
return to your previous position.
Following more than 90 days of service:
You'll return to the position you would have held without interruption, or a
position of equal seniority, pay, and status. We'll provide reasonable
accommodation if additional qualifications are needed. If accommodation isn't
successful, you'll return to your previous position
Reinstatement may not be possible only if:

Rouxbe's circumstances have changed, making re-employment impossible or
unreasonable. Your pre-service employment was brief and temporary with no
reasonable expectation of continuing indefinitely
Preserving Your Benefits
We value your service and ensure your time away doesn't affect your standing at
Rouxbe:
• Your military service counts toward seniority, 401(k) eligibility and vesting,
and benefit accruals
• This time also counts toward FMLA eligibility
• If you return with a disability incurred or aggravated during service, we will
provide reasonable accommodation as required by law
For additional information or support regarding military leave, please contact the
Controller, who serves as our dedicated resource for military-related employment
matters.
Thank you for your service – we're honored to support you both during your
military duties and upon your return to our team. During a period of military
conflict, Rouxbe provides eligible employees with up to fifteen (15) days of unpaid
leave to be with their military spouse who is notified of an impending call or order
to active duty, or who has been authorized for leave from deployment.
To be eligible for this benefit, you must be employed an average of twenty (20) or
more hours per week. You must notify your direct supervisor of your intention to
take the leave under this policy within five (5) business days following receipt of
the official military notice.
Health insurance benefits may continue at the level and conditions as provided
under applicable laws. Upon the completion of your leave, you may return to your
original position or an equivalent job.
