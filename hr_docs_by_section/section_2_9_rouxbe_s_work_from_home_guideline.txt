2.9 ROUXBE’S WORK FROM HOME GUIDELINE

Embracing Flexibility in How We Work
At Rouxbe, we believe exceptional work can happen anywhere. Our work-from-
home approach isn't just about location… it's about empowering you to create
your optimal environment for innovation, focus, and well-being. These guidelines
are designed to help you succeed in a remote setting while staying connected to
our shared mission.
Setting Yourself Up for Success - Your Digital Workspace
Equipment Empowerment: We'll provide technology to ensure you have the tools
you need, whether that's a laptop, a second monitor, or noise-canceling
headphones.
Connectivity Support: Strong internet is essential, if you need to upgrade your
service for reliable video calls, we'll have established a $50 monthly stipend
toward your internet costs.
Tech Troubleshooting: Patrick is always available through his Slack channel for
quick resolution of technical issues.
Your Physical Space
Dedicated Area: Designate a specific work area when possible, even if it's just a
corner of a room, to help create mental boundaries between work and personal
life.
Ergonomic Comfort: Take advantage of our virtual ergonomic assessment to
ensure your setup supports your physical well-being.
Personal Touch: Make your space inspiring, plants, good lighting, and personal
items can boost creativity and satisfaction. What works for you?
Reimagining Collaboration - Communication Rhythms
Core Collaboration Hours: While we embrace flexibility, we maintain core hours of
10 AM - 3 PM in your local time zone for scheduling team meetings and

collaborative sessions.
Response Expectations: We trust you to respond to messages within 4 business
hours during your workday, but not during your designated focus time or after
hours.
Status Transparency: Use Slack statuses to share your availability, whether you're
in deep work, stepping away for lunch, or finished for the day.
Meeting Mindfulness
Camera Comfort: Video is strongly encouraged when participating in team calls.
We are a completely virtual environment, and it is one way to keep engagement
levels high. Video is not always mandatory, we understand that some days are
better suited for audio-only participation.
Meeting-Free Zones: We protect Fridays as meeting-free days to provide flex time
or unincumbered focus.
Virtual Water Cooler: Join our optional monthly virtual coffee breaks to maintain
social connections beyond project work.
Work-Life Harmony - Flexible Scheduling
Outcome Focus: We measure success by results, not hours logged. Design your
schedule to align with your peak productivity times while ensuring coverage for
team needs.
Break Integration: Build movement into your day, we encourage the 50/10
approach: 50 minutes of focus followed by a 10-minute break.
Boundary Setting: Communicate your working hours to your team and honor
others' boundaries by scheduling messages to send during their working hours.
Wellbeing Priorities
