1.0 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO

Dear Valued Team Member,
Welcome to our family! It is with genuine excitement and gratitude that I welcome
you to the Rouxbe team. The document you're reading marks the beginning of what I
hope will be a remarkable journey of growth, innovation, and meaningful impact.
Every person who joins our team brings unique talents, perspectives, and experiences
that enrich our collective mission. We didn't just hire you for what you can do today,
we invited you to be part of our story because we see the potential in you to help
shape the future of learning and development.
At the heart of our organization is a profound belief: education has the power to
transform lives. Every course we develop, every feature we implement, and every
learner we support represents an opportunity to make someone's tomorrow better
than their today. As you settle into your role, I encourage you to keep this purpose at
the center of your work, knowing that your contributions extend far beyond the
immediate tasks at hand.
Our industry is evolving rapidly, and the challenges we face will require creativity,
resilience, and collaboration. There will be days of tremendous achievement and days
that test our resolve. On both kinds of days, please remember that you are never
alone here. We succeed together, we learn together, and we grow together.
I make these commitments to you:
• We will foster an environment where your voice matters and your ideas can
flourish
• We will provide the support, tools, and resources you need to excel
• We will recognize your contributions and celebrate your achievements

• We will prioritize your professional development and work-life balance
• We will cultivate a culture of respect, inclusion, and belonging
In return, I ask that you bring your authentic self to work each day, embrace our
values, challenge conventional thinking, and never lose sight of the learners whose
lives we aim to improve.
This employee manual contains important information about our policies, benefits,
and expectations. While it addresses many practical aspects of working here, what it
cannot fully capture is the spirit of innovation and care that defines our community.
My virtual door is always open, and I genuinely look forward to getting to know you.
Together, we will create not just an exceptional learning platform, but a better, more
accessible future of education for all.
With warmest regards and highest hopes,
Gary M. Apito
