ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25

At Rouxbe, we recognize that excellence thrives when you can align your work
schedule with your personal life. Our standard work week for full-time employees
is 40 hours, but we've designed a framework that puts you in control of how those
hours unfold.
Your Flexible Options
We trust you to manage your schedule within our collaborative framework. Many
of our team members have found success with compressed schedules, such as
four 10-hour days with Friday as a flex day. To support this flexibility, we typically
avoid scheduling internal meetings on Fridays.
Honoring Your Time Management
As a full-time exempt employee, we respect your judgment about when additional
hours might be necessary to complete important projects. We equally support
your choice to work outside standard business hours when it suits your
productivity style and personal commitments.
Balancing Flexibility with Connection
While we embrace flexibility, we also value the moments when we come together.
We ask that you prioritize team gatherings, scheduled meetings, team retreats,
and other collaborative events that strengthen our community and advance our
shared goals.
Our Trust in You
This approach reflects our confidence in your professionalism and commitment.
By giving you greater control over when and how you work, we believe you'll
create your optimal balance of focused productivity and personal fulfillment,
ultimately delivering your best contributions to our mission while thriving in all
aspects of your life.
