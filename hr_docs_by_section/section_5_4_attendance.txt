5.4 ATTENDANCE

Attendance is an important factor for your success with Rouxbe. We work as a
team and have many customers relying on our assistance. If you are going to be
absent or late for work, it is your responsibility to notify your supervisor.
If your supervisor is not available when you call or text, please make sure you
leave a message to ensure that they have been informed. If you are physically
unable to make the call, make sure to have someone else make the call in your
place. For any absences longer than three days, Rouxbe may request a written
release from your doctor to allow you back at work.
Personal issues requiring time away from your work, such as doctor's
appointments or other matters, should be scheduled during your non-working
hours if possible.
If you are absent for three (3) days without notifying us, it is assumed that you
have voluntarily abandoned your position with Rouxbe, and you may be
terminated from employment. If you cannot reach your direct supervisor, please
contact the Controller or CEO.
If you appear to be sick while at work, your supervisor or manager has the ability
to send you home as not to risk the spread of contagious germs. Employees are
eligible to use PTO to make up for non-working hours due to sickness.
