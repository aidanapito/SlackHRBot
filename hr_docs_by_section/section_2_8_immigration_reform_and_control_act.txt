2.8 IMMIGRATION REFORM AND CONTROL ACT

For US-based staff, in compliance with the federal Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), as amended, we are committed to employing only
individuals who are authorized to work in the United States.
Each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the
Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation
establishing identity and employment eligibility. This documentation must be
provided within 3 business days of starting employment with us. The inability to
provide this documentation within 3 business days is grounds for termination.
If you are authorized to work in the country for a limited time period, you will be
required to submit proof of renewed employment eligibility prior to expiration of
that period to remain employed by Rouxbe.
