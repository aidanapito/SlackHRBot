2.1 AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

Rouxbe is an at-will employer. This means that regardless of any provision in this
employee handbook, either you or Rouxbe may terminate the employment
relationship at any time, with or without reason, or with or without notice.
Nothing in this handbook, or in any documents or statement, written or oral, shall
limit the right to terminate employment at-will. Similarly, Rouxbe can alter job
duties, compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment at
any time.
No representative of the Company has any authority to enter into any agreement
for employment for any specified period, or to make other commitments or
promises or assure any benefit or terms and conditions of employment, unless
such promises are made in writing and signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, Gary Apito (gary@rouxbe.com).
Please refer to The Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement for
additional terms of employment.
For B.C. employees: The provisions of the Employment Standards Act, exclusively,
will be followed with respect to ‘without cause’ terminations.
