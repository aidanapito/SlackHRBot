3.5 WORKING TOGETHER TO MEET OUR GOALS: OVERTIME

POLICY
Our Commitment to Excellence
At Rouxbe, we're passionate about delivering exceptional experiences for our
customers. Sometimes, this dedication means coming together as a team to meet
specific deadlines or customer needs outside our regular schedule. When these
opportunities arise, we want to ensure clarity, fairness, and appreciation for your
additional contributions.
How We Navigate Overtime Together
When our customers or projects require additional time commitment, we'll provide
as much advance notice as possible. We recognize that your time is valuable, and
we strive to balance our business needs with respect for your personal time.
Non-exempt team members who contribute more than 40 hours in a workweek
(Sunday through Saturday) will receive compensation at one-and-a-half times their
regular hourly rate, in accordance with applicable laws. This reflects our
appreciation for your extra effort and dedication.
To ensure we're coordinating effectively, please partner with your manager to
receive pre-approval for any overtime hours. This collaborative approach helps us
plan resources efficiently while recognizing your willingness to go above and
beyond.
Understanding Overtime Calculations
We calculate overtime based on actual hours worked beyond 40 hours in a
workweek. While we value all your time - including holidays and paid time off - only
active working hours count toward overtime calculations.

For example:
If you work 8 hours Monday, use 8 hours of PTO Tuesday, and work 8.5 hours
Wednesday through Friday, your total working hours would be 33.5, which wouldn't
trigger overtime compensation.
Similarly, during holiday weeks, only your actual working hours count toward the
40-hour threshold for overtime.
If our pay period crosses a workweek boundary, remember that we still calculate
overtime based on the complete Sunday-through-Saturday cycle.
Our Shared Responsibility
We value your contribution and want to properly recognize additional time worked.
That's why we ask that all overtime be discussed and approved in advance. This
mutual understanding helps us maintain both operational excellence and
appropriate compensation practices.
If you have questions about how this policy applies to your specific situation, please
reach out to the Controller, who is here to support you with clear guidance and
information.
Together, we can balance delivering exceptional service while honoring our
commitments to each team member's wellbeing and fair compensation.
4 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

to the actual plan documents and summary plan descriptions if you have specific
