8.0 PIIA - PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND

INVENTIONS AGREEMENT
In exchange for my becoming employed (or my employment being continued), or
retained as a consultant (or my consulting relationship being continued), as the case
may be, by Rouxbe Video Technologies, Inc., a British Columbia corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Rouxbe Global Food Group, Inc., a Washington corporation,
or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or successors (collectively, the “Company”), and for any
cash and/or equity compensation for my services, I hereby agree as follows:
1. Duties. I will perform for the Company such duties as may be designated by the
Company from time to time. During my period of employment or consulting relationship
with the Company (as the case may be), I will devote my best efforts to the interests of
the Company and will not engage in other employment or in any activities detrimental
to the best interests of the Company without the prior written consent of the Company.
2. Confidentiality Obligation. I understand and agree that all Proprietary
Information (as defined below) shall be the sole property of the Company and its assigns,
including all trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and other rights in connection therewith.
I hereby assign to the Company any rights I may acquire in such Proprietary Information.
I will hold in confidence and not directly or indirectly use or disclose, both during my
employment by, or consulting relationship with, the Company (as the case may be) and
for a period of three (3) years after its termination (regardless of the reason for such
termination), any Proprietary Information I obtain or create during the period of my
employment or consulting relationship, whether or not during working hours, except to
the extent authorized by the Company, until such Proprietary Information becomes
generally known. I agree not to make copies of such Proprietary Information except as
authorized by the Company. Upon termination of my employment or consulting
relationship (as the case may be) or upon an earlier request of the Company, I will return
or deliver to the Company all tangible forms of such Proprietary Information in my
possession or control, including but not limited to drawings, specifications, documents,
records, devices, models or any other material and copies or reproductions thereof.
3. Ownership of Physical Property. All documents, apparatus, equipment,
materials, and other physical property in any form, whether or not pertaining to
Proprietary Information, furnished to me by the Company or produced by me or others
in connection with my employment or consulting relationship (as the case may be) shall
be and remain the sole property of the Company. I shall return to the Company all such
documents, apparatus, equipment, materials, and property as and when requested by
the Company, except only (a) my personal copies of records relating to my
compensation, (b) if applicable, my personal copies of any materials evidencing shares

ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25

of the Company’s capital stock purchased by me and/or options to purchase shares of
the Company’s capital stock granted to me, (c) my copy of this Agreement, and (d) my
personal property and personal documents I brought with me to the Company and any
personal correspondence and personal materials that I accumulated and kept at my
office during my employment or consulting relationship (as the case may be) (my
“Personal Documents”). Even if the Company does not so request, I shall return all such
documents, apparatus, equipment, materials, and property upon termination of my
employment or consulting relationship (as the case may be), and, except for my Personal
Documents, I will not take with me any such documents, material or property or any
reproduction thereof upon such termination.
4. Assignment of Inventions.
(a) Without further compensation, I hereby agree promptly to disclose to the
Company, all Inventions (as defined below) which I may solely or jointly develop or
reduce to practice during the period of my employment or consulting relationship with
the Company (as the case may be) which (a) pertain to any line of business activity of
the Company, (b) are aided by the use of time, material, or facilities of the Company,
whether or not during working hours, or (c) relate to any of my work during the period
of my employment or consulting relationship with the Company (as the case may be),
whether or not during normal working hours (“Company Inventions”). During the term
of my employment or consulting relationship (as the case may be), all Company
Inventions that I conceive, reduce to practice, develop, or have developed (in whole or
in part, either alone or jointly with others) shall be the sole property of the Company
and its assigns to the maximum extent permitted by law (and to the fullest extent
permitted by law shall be deemed “works made for hire”), and the Company and its
assigns shall be the sole owner of all patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and
other rights in connection therewith. I hereby assign to the Company any rights that I
may have or acquire in such Company Inventions.
(b) I attach hereto as Exhibit A a complete list of all Inventions, if any, made by me
prior to my employment or consulting relationship with the Company (as the case may
be) that are relevant to the Company’s business, and I represent and warrant that such
list is complete. If no such list is attached to this Agreement, I represent that I have no
such Inventions at the time of signing this Agreement. If in the course of my employment
or consulting relationship with the Company (as the case may be), I use or incorporate
into a product or process an Invention not covered by Section 4(a) of this Agreement in
which I have an interest, the Company is hereby granted a nonexclusive, fully paid-up,
royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license of my interest to use and sublicense such
Invention without restriction of any kind.
NOTICE REQUIRED BY REVISED CODE OF WASHINGTON 49.44.140:
PAGE 86
ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25

Any assignment of Inventions required by this Agreement does not apply to an Invention
for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company
was used and which was developed entirely on the employee’s own time, unless (a) the
Invention relates (i) directly to the business of the Company or (ii) to the Company’s
actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the Invention
results from any work performed by the employee for the Company.
5. Further Assistance; Power of Attorney. I agree to perform, during and after my
employment or consulting relationship with the Company (as the case may be), all acts
deemed necessary or desirable by the Company to permit and assist it, at its expense,
in obtaining and enforcing the full benefits, enjoyment, rights, and title throughout the
world in the Inventions assigned to the Company as set forth in Section 4 above. Such
acts may include, but are not limited to, execution of documents and assistance or
cooperation in legal proceedings. I hereby irrevocably designate the Company and its
duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in fact, to execute and file
on my behalf any such applications and to do all other lawful acts to further the
prosecution and issuance of patents, copyright, and mask work registrations related to
such Inventions. This power of attorney shall not be affected by my subsequent
incapacity.
6. Inventions. As used in this Agreement, the term “Inventions” means
discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, know-how, improvements,
inventions, trade secrets, and/or original works of authorship, whether or not
patentable, copyrightable, or otherwise legally protectable. This includes, but is not
limited to, any new product, machine, article of manufacture, biological material,
method, procedure, process, technique, use, equipment, device, apparatus, system,
compound, formulation, composition of matter, design, or configuration of any kind, or
any improvement thereon.
7. Proprietary Information. As used in this Agreement, the term “Proprietary
Information” means information or physical material not generally known or available
outside the Company or information or physical material entrusted to the Company by
third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, Inventions, confidential knowledge,
copyrights, product ideas, techniques, processes, formulas, object codes, source codes,
biological materials, mask works and/or any other information of any type relating to
documentation, laboratory notebooks, data, schematics, algorithms, flow charts,
mechanisms, research, manufacture, improvements, assembly, installation, marketing,
forecasts, sales, pricing, customers, customer lists, customer data, including but not
limited to customers’ personally identifiable information, the salaries, duties,
qualifications, performance levels, and terms of compensation of other employees,

its operations. Proprietary Information may be contained in material such as drawings,
samples, procedures, specifications, reports, studies, customer or supplier lists, budgets,
cost or price lists, compilations, or computer programs, or may be in the nature of
unwritten knowledge or know-how.
8. Solicitation of Employees, Consultants, and Other Parties. During the term of
my employment or consulting relationship with the Company (as the case may be), and
for a period of three (3) years following the termination of my employment or consulting
relationship with the Company (as the case may be) for any reason, I shall not directly
or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company’s employees or
consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt any of the
foregoing, either for myself or any other person or entity. For a period of one (1) year
following termination of my employment or consulting relationship with the Company
(as the case may be) for any reason, I shall not solicit any licensor to or customer of the
Company or licensee of the Company’s products, that are known to me, with respect to
any business, products or services that are directly and materially competitive to the
products or services offered by the Company or under development as of the date of
termination of my relationship with the Company.
9. No Conflicts. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement
as an employee of or consultant to the Company (as the case may be) does not and will
not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information, knowledge,
or data acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to my becoming an employee or
consultant of the Company (as the case may be), and I will not disclose to the Company,
or induce the Company to use, any confidential or proprietary information or material
belonging to any previous employer or others. I agree not to enter into any written or
oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.
10. No Interference. I certify that I am not a party to any other agreement which
will interfere with my full compliance with this Agreement and I have not executed any
non-compete clauses from previous employers that would prohibit my employment at
Rouxbe.
11. Effects of Agreement. This Agreement (a) shall survive for a period of five (5)
years beyond the termination of my employment by or consulting relationship with the
Company (as the case may be), (b) inures to the benefit of successors and assigns of the
Company, and (c) is binding upon my heirs and legal representatives.
12. At-Will Relationship. I understand and acknowledge that my employment or
consulting relationship with the Company (as the case may be) is and shall continue to
be at-will, as defined under applicable law, meaning that either I or the Company may
terminate the relationship at any time for any reason or no reason, without further
PAGE 88
ROUXBE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK UPDATED 01/01/25

obligation or liability.
13. Injunctive Relief. I acknowledge that violation of this Agreement by me may
cause irreparable injury to the Company, and I agree that the Company will be entitled
to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining
orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions without the necessity of
posting a bond or other security and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies
that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.
14. Miscellaneous. This Agreement and the exhibits to this Agreement constitute
the entire understanding and agreement of the parties to this Agreement concerning
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede any oral, written, or other
communications or agreements concerning the subject matter of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be amended or waived only by a written instrument signed by me and
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Washington applicable to contracts entered into and performed
entirely within the State of Washington, without giving effect to principles of conflict of
laws. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable under applicable
law, then such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement only to the extent
unenforceable, and the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement shall be
enforceable in accordance with its terms.
