2.6 TALK TO US

We encourage you to bring your questions, suggestions and complaints to our
attention. We will carefully consider each of these in our continuing effort to
improve operations. We want each employee to feel free to offer their personal
recommendations for improvements, as well as discuss any problems they may be
experiencing on the job.
We are committed to maintaining a positive and pleasant working environment.
We believe that an open-door policy is the best method for our employees. If you
feel you have a problem, present the situation to your supervisor so that the
problem can be settled by examination and discussion of the facts. You can also
speak with the Controller.
Your suggestions and comments on any subject are important, and we encourage
you to take every opportunity to discuss them with us. Your job will not be
adversely affected in any way because you choose to use this procedure. We will
respectfully listen to your concerns and do our best to address them.
