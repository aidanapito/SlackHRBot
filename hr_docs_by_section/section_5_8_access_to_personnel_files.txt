5.8 ACCESS TO PERSONNEL FILES

Employees may inspect their own personnel files annually. Please submit a written
request to the Controller if you would like to review your file. You are not
permitted to remove or alter any documents from your personnel files. If you
disagree with a document in the file, you may place a statement in the file.
Personnel files exclude information relating to a criminal investigation and records
compiled in preparation for an impending lawsuit that would not be available to
another party.
