4.1 MEDICAL AND DENTAL INSURANCE

Full-time employees who work 30 hours or more per week are eligible to
participate in Rouxbe’s insurance plan(s). You are eligible to enroll on the first of
the next month after your start date or during Open Enrollment. However, if you
undergo a change in family status, you may make a change in coverage provided
you do so within 30 days from the date of the qualifying event. You may not make
a mid-year change from one medical carrier to another. If you have questions
regarding insurance coverage, please contact the Controller.
To assist you with the cost of this insurance, Rouxbe pays 100% of employee
coverage and 100% of monthly premiums for spouse or family coverage. Rouxbe
makes this commitment to our teams and their families, so they don’t have to
worry about the cost of insurance. We are also committed to providing a high
level of health plan (platinum and gold) so our team members and their families
are taken care of.
A booklet containing the details of the plan and eligibility requirements may be
obtained from the Controller. Refer to the actual plan document and summary
plan description if you have specific questions regarding benefit plans. Those
documents take precedent.
