3.2 PAY DAY

Canadian employees are paid semi-monthly. The first pay period starts on the 1st
of the month and ends on the 15th of the month. The second pay period starts on
the 16th of the month and ends on the last day of the month. Paydays fall on the
15th and last day of each month.
U.S. employees are paid every two weeks. Follow the pay date schedule in Just
Works. When our payday falls on a holiday or weekend, you will be paid on the
business day before the holiday or weekend.
Please review your paycheck for every payroll for errors. If you find a mistake,
report it to your supervisor immediately. Your supervisor will assist you in taking
the steps necessary to correct the error. Any overpayments or underpayments will
be corrected on the first payroll after the mistake is brought to our attention.

Paycheck Deductions
We are required by law to make certain deductions from your paycheck each pay
period. Such deductions typically include federal, state and/or provincial taxes and
Social Security (FICA) taxes. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you are
employed and the benefits you choose, there may be additional deductions. If you
wish to have additional voluntary deductions deducted from your pay, it is your
responsibility to contact the Controller. All deductions and the amount of the
deductions are listed on your pay stub. W-2’s for U.S. employees and TD1’s for
Canadian employees will be sent out on or before January 31st of each calendar
year.
