5.18 IF YOU MUST LEAVE US

Should you decide to leave your employment with us, we ask that you provide
your supervisor or manager with at least two weeksâ€™ advance notice. Please
provide this notice in writing. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated and will be noted
favorably should you ever wish to reapply for employment with us.
Employees who are rehired following a break in service in excess of three months,
other than an approved leave of absence, must serve a new initial probationary
period whether or not such a period was previously completed. Such employees
are considered new employees from the effective date of their rehire for all
purposes, including the measuring of benefits unless stated otherwise in benefit
plan documents.
Additionally, all resigning employees should complete a brief exit interview prior
to leaving. On your last day working, you must return all property including, but
not limited to key cards, laptops, physical keys, company credit cards, etc.
Otherwise, we may take action to recoup any replacement costs and/or seek the
return of our property through payroll deduction and/or appropriate legal
recourse. In addition, you must continue to protect confidential proprietary
information, including trade secrets and inventions, if applicable, even after
leaving Rouxbe.
Note that any ongoing commission and incentive plans are no longer valid once
you leave the organization. Make sure to consider this when making your decision
to stay in our organization or move on to other opportunities.
You should notify us at accounting@rouxbe.com if your address changes during
the calendar year in which termination occurs so that your tax information will be
sent to the proper address.
