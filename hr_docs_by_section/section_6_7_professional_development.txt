6.7 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

With our employees as our greatest resource, ongoing training and development
is an important strategy for our people as well as our business development. The
Company encourages employee learning and growth to develop their maximum
personal and occupational potential through participation in training and
development activities.
Effective training and development programs reflect a match between the
organizationâ€™s goals for improved results and return on investment and employee
goals for skills and personal growth and opportunities for future advancement.
Manager/Supervisors will provide advice and guidance to help their staff further
their careers and thereby raise the level of motivation, job satisfaction and
performance in their departments. Inter-departmental and intra-departmental
cross training is encouraged.
Employees are encouraged to take Rouxbe courses as part of their development.
These courses are available to Rouxbe employees free of charge.
